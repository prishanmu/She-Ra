Swift Wind: Are you sure we're going the right way? Like, 100 percent sure?

Adora: [Sigh] For the last time, I don't know. We have to trust that the navigation system knows what it's doing. Now stop asking.

Bow: We've got to be close. Any minute now. Beast Island is around here. Somewhere.

Adora: We will find it. [Sigh] We have to.

Bow: Do you think Glimmer will still be upset when we get back? We did sort of, kind of, completely disobey direct orders

Adora: She'll understand. We all want what's best for Etheria. And once we get Entrapta back, Glimmer will know we made the right decision.

Bow: Right, but—I mean what if she doesn't? What if she never talks to me again?

[Alarm beeps]

Adora: Uh, Bow? The thing that's blinking, should it be blinking?

Bow: Uhh, I don't know, a ship?

Swift Wind: Uh, guys, I'm sensing something out there. Something big, and it's not good. And I think I hear—


[All Shout] [The ship's alarms start going off]


Bow: Don't panic, no one panic. [Groans]

[Brief Pause]

Bow: Uh, nope! Never mind, Panic!


[All Shout, gradually dying down as they descend into the water]


Swift Wind: Ehh

Adora: Look. It's Beast Island.


[Intro Theme]


Adora: As kids, we were warned of the dangers of Beast Island. There were the Chibbits with razor-sharp teeth, Scruffers with razor-sharp horns, Razorfins with—

Bow: Razor-sharp fins?!

Adora: Razor-sharp teeth, actually. I don't know why it had that name

Swift Wind: Adora! [Sniffs scrap metal] [Bug crawling noises] Okay! That's normal.

Adora: [Gasps] Entrapta. She must have been on it.

Swift Wind: Where do you think she went?


[Droning Noise]


Swift Wind: What is that noise?

Bow: What noise?

Swift Wind: [Grunts] It's gone [Grunts again] You didn't hear it?

Bow: Uh, any scary Horde bedtime stories about noises only horses can hear?

Adora: Not that I can remember.

Swift Wind: I heard the same sound earlier, right before Mara's ship crashed.

Bow: First Ones' tech. This is all First Ones' tech. But it's corrupted, melted down. This must've been some kind of First Ones' dumping ground

Adora: We should get moving while we still have light. Entrapta's here somewhere.


[Creature roars distantly]


Swift Wind: [sung] On this awful nightmare island, [Adora groans] which we went to on purpose, so everything's great. Hey, let's take a fun stroll through nightmare island, just kidding, it's definitely not weird and scary. [creatures chittering] I wanna go home.


[Chittering creatures stop]


Swift Wind: Maybe everything went quiet... for a good reason.


[Creature growls]


Adora: Nope, a bad reason.

Bow: Okay, no one move. Maybe it won't see us.


[Clanging of metal creature] [Everyone shouting]


Adora: For the honor of Grayskull!


[Spark noises emit from the sword]


Adora: [gasps]

Bow: Uh... Adora?

Adora: Run!


[Metal creature screeching]


[Swift Wind falls and grunts]


Bow: What happened? Why can't you be She-Ra?

Adora: I don't know!


[Droning Sound]


Swift Wind: There it is again, that sound.


[Droning Sound]


Swift Wind: Really, no one else hears that?


[Adora gasps upon seeing the monster, then Bow] [All shouting]


Adora: No! Come on, come on. For the honor of Grayskull! [Shouts, then grunts]

Bow: Adora!


[Another man jumps into the frame. He has a cloak and long, grey-brown hair with a beard]


Man: [Grunts and shouts while fighting]

Bow: Woah.

Adora: Who is that guy? Thank you, you saved us. Who—?

Bow: [Gasps] King Micah.


[in the Crystal Castle]


Glimmer: Light Hope? [Clears Throat] The queen of Bright Moon demands to speak to Light Hope. Now. [silence] On behalf of the Great Rebellion, I need you to answer my questions. [Silence] Eternia? Okay I know you can hear me. [silence] So that's how it is. Fine. I'll just have to make you listen. [Slams down staff]

Light Hope: [Intercom] Unauthorized presence detected. Security protocol activated.


[Spiders screech]


Glimmer: You're not getting rid of me that easily.


[On Beast Island]


Adora: Your Majesty

Man/King Micah: Huh? You know who I am? Please don't kneel. I'm no king here.

Adora: Of course we know. Oh, uh I'm Adora, and this is Swift Wind and Bow.

Bow: King Micah, It's so great to— [King Micah grabs Bow's face] —meet you.

King Micah: Huh. Apologies. It's been... quite some time since I've talked to anyone else. Anyone real, that is. And you are real, Right?!

Bow: Very real. Huh, yeah. Hi. Uh... Are you real? I mean, we kinda thought you were dead.

Micah: If the horde had their way, I would be. They exiled me here, but I survived!

Adora: King Micah, we're from Bright Moon. We know your daughter, Glimmer.

Micah: My sweet Glimmer? Huh? [Creature noises] There's no time for pleasantries! We have to move quick, follow me!


[Micah uses sorcery to make the group safe]


Bow: Woah.

Micah: We should be able to rest here for a moment. A safe, quiet mo—


[Micah dives to the ground] [All shout]


Micah: Gotcha! Oh— I'm so sorry. Where are my manners? Bug?

Adora: Uh, mmh. No.

Bow: [whines and moves away]

Micah: [Easts the bug] So, what brings you to Beast Island?

Adora: Uh, We came here looking for our friend, Princess Entrapta. Any chance you've seen her? She's got purple hair and really like robots. Like, realy, really likes robots.

Micah: Yeah, I know her. She stole my rations. Only the tiny ones for some reason.


Adora: That's great! I mean, not the food part, but the other part. She's okay, or she was not long ago.

Swift Wind: Did you see which way she went?

Micah: Why yes, sh— Is that horse talking?!

Swift Wind: I can hear you. I'm swift wind, and I—

Micah: It has wings!

Swift Wind: Well, this is definitely Glimmer's dad.

Bow: Your Majesty, could you let me go?

Micah: Huh? Oh, right. [Chuckles] Sorry. Like I said, it's been a little while since I've talked to people, or horses. Because horses talk now, and that's normal.

Adora: You were saying something about Entrapta. Do you know where she is?

Micah: Yes. Your friend headed straight for the center of the island before I could stop her.

Bow: Sounds like Entrapta. Could you point us in the direction—

Micah: You can't go there! You'd never come back. It's where the signal is the strongest.

Swift Wind: The signal. That must be the noise I've been hearing. What is it?

Pookas rearing
Micah: You've heard it? Then we have to hurry. This place is a mass of ancient tech, mostly degraded but some of it still works. And something at the center of that island never stopped signaling. The signal dulls your resolve, exposes your vulnerabilities, it pulls you in. Everything that stays on Beast Island becomes a part of it eventually.
Bow: Why can't Adora and I hear it?

Micah: Stay here long enough, and you will. I've heard it every day, for months, years. I have no sense of time here. But I fight it! Nothing ill stop me from getting off this island and reuniting with my family. But enough about me. Tell me news of the Rebellion and Bright Moon. And my baby girl. You know her?

Adora: Glimmer? Sure. She's... Well, she's—

Bow: She's our best friend. We're the Best Friend Squad.

Micah: Sounds like my baby girl. Hm. Always in a hurry to grow up and be friends with the older kids. What about Angella? Have you seen her?

Adora: Your Majesty, I—


[Creature screeching]


Bow: What is that?

Micah: We should keep moving. I'll help you find your friend, and then, can you help me escape this place?

Bow: Of course. We'll all get out of here together.

Micah: Then why are we waiting? Follow me!


[all start following Micah] [Bow sees a creature and screams]

Micah: So you're telling me that horses are now allowed in the War Room, and they all get chairs?

Swift Wind: Big, important chairs, yep! And also, unlimited sugar cubes.

Micah: Eh, sounds good to me. [Kills bug]

Adora: I can't believe Glimmer's dad has been alive this whole time. And he's so cool. A Little weird, but I guess that's to be expected after all this time alone.

Bow: Glimmer will be so happy to see her dad again. She'll have to forgive us for going against her orders, escaping Bright Moon, and taking Mara's ship. Not that we technically did anything wrong, or need to be forgiven. I mean, Glimmer kept us in the dark. The truth is she hasn't been a good friend. But have we been? Can you even have a fight with a best friend and still be best friends? And don't get me started on Shadow Weaver. [Short pause] Are you okay?

Adora: [Sigh] Yeah, it's just— Why can't I be She-Ra here? What if something on this island infected the sword, or what if Glimmer is right an-an-and all I do is ruin everything? I... I just feel useless.

Bow: Hey, you aren't useless. We'll figure this out. You're still a hero, I'm still a tech master, Swift Wind's still—

Swift Wind: Woo-hoo! [Shouts] That's not food!

Bow: He's still a horse. But now we've got Cool Sorcerer Dad helping us.

Adora: You're right.


[At the Crystal Castle]


Glimmer: Are you gonna send more spiders for me to destroy, or are you gonna talk to me? The First Ones stole the magic of Etheria, the magic of my people. Please, talk to me! That magic is how I stop this war. It's how I save everyone. That magic, the magic at the Heart of Etheria... I want to use it.

Light Hope: [Intercom] Temporary administrator access granted to Queen Glimmer of Bright Moon. Queen Glimmer, proceed.
