Light Hope: Hello, Adora.

Shadow Weaver: Adora...

[Glimmer and Bow laughing]

Catra: Every hero needs a sidekick...right?

Adora: For the honor...of Grayskull!

Entrapta: I just need a little more time!

[Adora screams, then again in surprise at ry]

Light Hope: Hello, Adora. [Adora shrieks] You've come at last.

Adora: Light Hope... I can't believe I'm really seeing you. I mean, I've seen you [chuckles nervously] in my brain, I think. But this is real! [chuckles nervously again] Is this real? Wait, am I dead? I fell...I'm sorry, I'm freaking out. [clears throat] I'm Adora.

Light Hope: Yes, I know. I have been waiting for you since you were an infant, but I could not reach you. And I could not protect you from the Horde. I watched you grow up from afar.

Adora: Wow, that's--that's kind of creepy, honestly.

Light Hope: Creepy? Yes. I have been called this before. I chose this form so as not to alarm you, but if it does not suit you, I will choose another.

[Light Hope disappears and reappears in a different form]

Light Hope: Is this better? [Adora shrieks]

Adora: Oh, no. That's--that's, um, that's definitely way worse.

[Light Hope changes back]

Light Hope: Forgive me. My human protocol is many years out of date. [Form and digital tone shifts and glitches] Allow me to select a new form that you will find appealing.

Adora: Ooh, no, no, that's, thank you! No, that's enough, tha--no, that's--that's, that's t-totally okay, please stop! [Groans]

[Opening Theme]


[Bright Moon Castle, Glimmer's Room]

Glimmer: But shouldn't she be [glitches and grunts] back by now? She said she was gonna [glitches and grunts] get training to [glitches and grunts] fix me! How long is that going to take--[runs into chair, chair squeaks across floor] OW! [sharp intake of breath] And what kind of monster puts a chair here?!

Bow: Okay, I'm worried, too, Glimmer, but taking it out on the furniture isn't going to help.

Glimmer: We can't sit here and hope that she comes back eventually. We have to do something.

Bow: Like what?

[knocking on door]

Guard: Princess? There's, uh, something here to see you.

Glimmer: Don't you mean someone?

Guard: No. I mean something.

[Swift Wind clops and whinnies down the hallway]

Bow: Our horse!

Swift Wind: I am my own horse. Call me [in a deeper, more regal voice] Swift Wind!

[Glimmer and Bow scream]

Bow: Our horse can talk! [gasps]

Swift Wind: Yeah, yeah, I can speak my mind now, pretty crazy--SO, I was thinking--

Bow: He's a talking hoOoOoOrse!

Swift Wind: As we've established. Now--

Glimmer: He has wings!

Swift Wind: Okay, I'll give you a moment to freak out, and then we need to talk.

[Glimmer and Bow both gasping]

Swift Wind: [blusters] --Great! I think Adora needs our help. Since Adora transformed me, I've been able to feel where she is at all times. It's like instinct. But now I feel a pull, as if I'm being summoned to her side.

[Bow touches Swift Wind's wing and gasps ecstatically]

Swift Wind: As part of Adora's herd, I need your help. Will you come?

[Glimmer glitches, then hums resolutely]

Glimmer: Of course. Lead the way.

Bow: But, Glimmer, your glitching.

Glimmer: Is what got us into this. Adora left to save me. Now it's time for us to save her. You in?

Bow: Always. But...I don't think your mom is going to like us leaving so soon after our last mission.

Glimmer: She doesn't need to know. We'll sneak out and be back before my mom even realizes we're gone.

[Glimmer opens the door to Angella standing there]

Glimmer: [glitches and shouts] Mom!

[Angella clears her throat]

Glimmer: What are you doing here?

Angella: Coming to see why my guard was escorting a horse into your room.

Swift Wind: I like to think of myself more as a role model for all horse kind. ...I mean, uh, what talking horse? [chuckles nervously] What's happening?

Angella: You should get going if you want to track down Adora.

Glimmer: You're not gonna stop us?

Angella: Glimmer. I told you I regretted giving up after your father died. I will not consign you to the same regrets. [voice becomes authoritative] Commander Glimmer. I order you to continue your mission to find Adora, and bring her back home.

Glimmer: Right away, Your Majesty. ...Come on!

Swift Wind: Uh, when we're back, I'd like to talk about freeing all the horses in your stables. [Bow chuckles nervously and grunts, pushing Swift Wind away] I think that's seriously--

Bow: [grunting] Later!

Swift Wind: Hey! Hey! I'm still talking to the queen! [neighs]

Angella: Please be careful.


[The Fright Zone, Entrapta's holding area/lab]

Catra: Okay, I--what is going on here?

Entrapta: [busts through a vent with her hair] Catra! You got my note.

Catra: The one you dropped on my head from the air vent that says, 'Come to my lab'?

Entrapta: Yes, that's the one. I've made great strides in analyzing the data from the First Ones data crystal you brought me... Look!

Catra: Where did all of this come from?

Entrapta: Oh, you know. Here and there...rooms...

Catra: Were there people in these rooms?

Entrapta: Well, not when I went back to take the stuff.

Catra: [chuckles] You definitely belong here with us.

Entrapta: ...So! The data! [squeals in excitement]

[Entrapta fits the crystal into a slot, machines whir to life]

Scorpia: Ha! [laughing] Wow! [gasps] Whoa. [scribbling on notepad]

Entrapta: Look at these readings. It's incredible, this seems to confirm my theories about the techno-organic nature of First Ones machinery resulting in thaumaturlogical compatibility between magic and science! [laughs maniacally]

Catra: I'm going to need you to try again, but this time, talk like a normal person.

Entrapta: Scorpia seems like she understands.

[Scorpia scribbling]

Catra: Scorpia is drawing stick figures holding hands.

Scorpia: I call it 'Super Pal Trio'! This is me, this is Catra, and I think it's clear, come on. I mean, I'm a bit of an artist.

Entrapta: [slowly and enunciating syllables] I looked at the rock, which is a crys-tal, and used math...wait, do I have to explain math to you?

Catra: [groans exasperatedly] Yes or no, did the crystal give you enough data to upgrade our weapons?

Entrapta: Weapons? HA! This is so much bigger than weapons. This could change everything. Etheria's not just a planet. Whatever the First Ones did to it, it went deep.

Catra: And what does that mean?

Entrapta: You're asking me about my theories? I've waited years for someone to ask me about my theories! Hang on, I made a model!

[Catra grunts as she and Scorpia are pulled offscreen by Entrapta]


[Crystal Castle]

Adora: I don't want to be rude, but, um...who are you?

Light Hope: I am Light Hope, Etheria's facilitator. I was created by the First Ones, as you call them.

Adora: Okay, quick follow-up...who are the First Ones?

Light Hope: The First Ones were explorers who journeyed from beyond the stars to settle Etheria. They built this place for you...the Crystal Castle.

[Adora shouts when Light Hope appears suddenly next to her]

Light Hope: Adora, I've waited so long for you, and now the time has come to show you your destiny.

Adora: Great, because I actually had a quest--

Light Hope: You are She-Ra, Etheria's champion, appointed by the First Ones to protect and unite our planet. There have been many before you, but the line was broken. [Adora gasps when the hologram She-Ra disappears] You are the first She-Ra in a thousand years.

[Scene Transition to The Fright Zone, Entrapta's lab]

Entrapta: Behold! Etheria. The First Ones didn't just settle on the surface of Etheria, their technology runs throughout the planet's core. This whole planet it's--it's all First Ones' tech.

[Scene Transition back to the Crystal Castle]

Light Hope: Everything on Etheria is connected. The princesses are granted power over the elements through their Runestones. As She-Ra, it is your duty to bring the princesses together. Only then can balance be restored to Etheria.

[Adora gasps slightly when her hand goes through a holographic silhouette of Glimmer]

Adora: [haltingly] That sounds great, but the things is--

Light Hope: You are correct. It is great.

[Scene Transition back to the Fright Zone]

Catra: And what are these supposed to be?

Entrapta: Runestones. From the data I've managed to extract, they regulate the planet through the princesses. They're directly connected to each other and to the planet's power grid in a delicate balance.

Catra: Which means?

Entrapta: Which means they're our best access point to hack the planet.

[Scene Transition back to the Crystal Castle]

Light Hope: When the princesses and their elements are in balance, Etheria functions as it should. [Adora gasps as Light Hope projects atrocities the Horde has committed] But the Horde is destroying us in their quest for power. There is no predicting what they will do next.

[Scene Transition back to the Fright Zone]

Catra: Hack the planet?

Entrapta: Hypothetically, but it's not so simple. There's only a handful of Runestones in the whole world.

Scorpia: Runestone? You mean like the Black Garnet? 'Cause [chuckles] we have the Black Garnet.

Entrapta: The Black Garnet? You have a Runestone? The Fright Zone has a Runestone?

Scorpia: Uh, duh. It was my family's. But when the Horde landed, we gave it to Hordak, who then gave it to Shadow Weaver, who--you know, you tell a friend, he tells a friend, it's like, it's kind of one of those things.

[Scorpia grunts when Entrapta latches onto her]

Entrapta: [manically, yelling] Where is it?! Can I see it, can I touch it?!

Catra: Okay, calm down. What exactly are you planning on doing to the Black Garnet?

Entrapta: If we hack the Runestone grid, we could boost the Garnet's power and use it for...well, anything. As a power source, as--

Catra: A weapon?

Entrapta: Potentially! But if it's like my other experiments, the results will be explosive.

Scorpia: I don't think Shadow Weaver will like that.

Catra: Scorpia's right. Shadow Weaver won't like it. ...So, I will absolutely get you the Black Garnet. Leave it all to me.

[Hordak's Imp skitters across the ventilation above their heads, crawls up to Hordak's throne]

Hordak: What do you have for me, little spy?

Imp: [opens mouth, a recording of Entrapta is replayed]: Catra! I've made great strides in analyzing the data from the First Ones data crystal you brought me... Look!


[Crystal Castle]

Adora: This is all super good information, um, and I can't wait to hear more [chuckles nervously] just one thing, though--

Light Hope: Is there something you do not understand? I can start again from the beginning, if you would like. [Adora shakes her hands and groans negatively, Light Hope disappears then reappears where she stood initially in the room] I am Light Hope, Etheria's facilitator--

[Adora walks forward and scares herself by fazing through Light Hope, shouts]

Adora: No, no, I got it.

Light Hope: Have I mentioned that you are chosen?

Adora: Can we skip to the part about my powers? I need to learn how to heal my friend.

Light Hope: Your...friend?

Adora: Yes. Shadow Weaver did something to Glimmer and took her powers away. I need to figure out how to heal her.

Light Hope: Her connection with her Runestone was disrupted.

Adora: Can I fix it?

Light Hope: You will be able to do many incredible things...with training.

Adora: Great. So, uh, how long will this training take--like a day, or--

Light Hope: Years.

Adora: Years?! Glimmer doesn't have years. She's hurt because of me, I messed up. I got Glimmer and Bow captured, and Entrapta--it's my fault! ...I have to fix it.

Light Hope: Yes, your mission is to fix the planet.

Adora: My mission is to help my friends. That's why I came here.

Light Hope: You are She-Ra. Your purpose is to protect all of Etheria. You cannot help only your friends.

Adora: Why can't I do both?

Light Hope: Adora, you do not yet realize the power you have. [hand glitches as she 'touches' Adora's shoulder] You are distracted by your attachments. There was one before you who could not let go. Her name was Mara.

Adora: Mara? Madame Razz's Mara? What happened to her?

Light Hope: Mara was the last She-Ra before you. She struggled with a power that she could not control. Until it became too much for her mind.

Adora: ...She snapped?

Light Hope: She was compromised. She gave in to fear and faulty reasoning. Her desperate actions led to devastation. Mara stranded us in the empty dimension of Despandos. She broke the She-Ra line. She nearly destroyed us.

Light Hope: ...Adora. I have waited here for a thousand years alone. I did not know if I would ever see another She-Ra. You must stay here and train. Learn to be the She-Ra that Mara could not be.

Adora: I will. I will do whatever you want. I'll come back, and train, and learn about everything. But I have to heal Glimmer first. I can save the planet and save her.

[Adora gasps as Light Hope summons holograms of Adora's most regretted memories]

[Glimmer shouting in distress as she fights through Shadow Weaver's restraints in E9]

Catra: Adora? [backing away into the smoke at the assault on Thaymor in E2]

Entrapta: I just need a little more time--I just need a little more time! [typing into a keypad shortly before her 'demise' in E9]

Light Hope: You feel guilt at these memories. It is as you said, your friends are endangered by your presence. It is better to let go now.

Adora: But...I can't just leave my friends...


[The Fright Zone, the Black Garnet chamber]

[Entrapta and Scorpia welding and placing metal panels]

Catra: Alright, hurry it up, those machines aren't going to hook up themselves.

Shadow Weaver: [angrily] They won't be hooked up at all.

Scorpia: [losing her voice] Shadow Weaver! Uh--[clears throat]--We just, uh--

Shadow Weaver: [shouts, echoing] Silence! Did you really think you could invade my inner sanctum without me noticing? I never thought you were so bold as to openly rebel, but it will be my pleasure to put you back in your place!

[Scorpia and Entrapta whimper in fear, Emily beeps]

Catra: Oh, Shadow Weaver. I can do whatever I want with this hunk of rock.

Shadow Weaver: [chuckles] Absurd, by whose authority?

Hordak: By mine.

[Hordak pops up on a screen behind them, then all around the room]

Shadow Weaver: [surprised, respectfully] Lord Hordak! I don't understand.

Hordak: Catra and Entrapta have been working on a way to meld this strange First Ones tech with our machines to weaponize it. I found out...[scratches Imp's chin, Imp squeaks happily]...and was intrigued. I gave Force Captain Catra and her team my blessing to go ahead. ...So, understand, Shadow Weaver. I am displeased with your interruption.

Shadow Weaver: [desperate, angrily] My Lord, you're really going to let this--this princess tinker with my Runestone?!

Hordak: Her tinkering has increased the firepower of every weapon she's touched. So yes, she gets to tinker with whatever she wants. Including the Black Garnet, which is mine to give or take, as I see fit.

Shadow Weaver: You can't... You can't do this! I alone have learned how to draw power from it, a feat no sorceress has done before! I have unlocked its potential!

Hordak: And you wasted it on parlor tricks. Force Captain Catra, proceed. The Garnet is yours.

Catra: Yes, Lord Hordak.

Shadow Weaver: [exploding with shadowy magic in anger] NO!

[Catra leaps out of the way of magic grunting, Scorpia groans as glass breaks all around them]

Catra: [shouts] Stop her! Don't let her touch the--

Shadow Weaver: You will not take what is mine!

[The Black Garnet whirs with magical energy and bolts of lightning as Shadow Weaver charges up. After seeing Shadow Weaver generate a sphere of magic around herself, Scorpia grunts and lunges for her. Shadow Weaver yells, throwing binding magic on both Scorpia and Entrapta as Entrapta screams. Catra grunts as she dodges every magical blast.]

Shadow Weaver: That's right, run away. It's the only thing you've ever been good at! [Pieces of the metal infrastructure in the room impale the ground where Catra stood] You have always been a disappointment. You've learned nothing from me!

Catra: Oh, no. I've learned everything from you. How to predict when you'll strike, how to dodge, how to resist. You thought you were punishing me all these years? Wrong. You were training me for this day!

[Catra grunts as she claws at and breaks the piece of Runestone in Shadow Weaver's mask]

Shadow Weaver: [distraught, screaming] NO!

[The magic dissipates; Scorpia groans in relief as she is let free, Entrapta embraces Emily as she beeps]

Shadow Weaver: [desperately, fiddling with the pieces of the Runestone on the floor] Come back...Come back to me! Come back to me!

Catra: Scorpia, restrain the sorceress. [the pieces of the Runestone clatter on the ground] We won't have to worry about her any longer. Entrapta, if you would.

[Entrapta sighs in anticipation, Emily boops]

Entrapta: Alright, everyone. Let's get weird.

[The Black Garnet whirs with energy and builds up electrical magic around itself]

Scorpia: [gasps] Look!

[the shadows in the room collect at the Runestone as it continues to whir louder; the sconces in the room shatter, Entrapta gasps; a raw blast of energy shoots up through the roof of the chamber into the sky, creating lightning]


[Whispering Woods]

Swift Wind: And then I realized I'm free, but the other horses aren't. So I named myself Swift Wind after the swift winds of revolution and left to go kick down stable doors. Freedom, equality, and hay for all!

[leaves rustling]

Glimmer: Do you guys hear that?

[Bushes rustle more as creatures burst from them, Glimmer grunts when they run past. The bushes rustle more and a giant bug emerges]

[Glimmer shrieks and grunts when she glitches]

Bow: Get behind me!

[The bug roars as it thunders away]

Glimmer: What was that about?

Swift Wind: [nervously] I feel something. We should run. ...No. We have to get Adora. Adora, then run.

Bow: Swift Wind, what is it?

Swift Wind: [nervously] A bad thing. Hurry. [whimpers]

[Scene Transition; The Fright Zone, The Black Garnet chamber]

Entrapta: Amazing! The Garnet is siphoning energy at a near exponential rate. Yet the output is still building...!

Catra: What does that mean?

Entrapta: It means things are getting interesting.

[Scene Transition; Whispering Woods]

Bow: Is it just me, or is it really cold?

[The wind blows, snow falling]

Glimmer: It's...snowing?

Bow: That's impossible. It never snows in the Whispering Woods.

[Sudden explosion of cold wind, the crew grunts]

Glimmer: What's happening?!

Swift Wind: The bad thing!

[Lightning sparks in the sky]

Bow: We can't stay here! Swift Wind, do you sense Adora?

Swift Wind: [Grunts, horn humming with magic] There! She's over there!

[The crew makes their way to the front of the Crystal Castle, pounding on the side and grunting]

Glimmer: [angrily] This would be a great time for my powers to come back!

Swift Wind: Wait...wait! I know this. Hang on, I think I can--

[Swift Wind's horn glows with magic, he touches the castle, and the door rumbles open]

[Swift Wind neighs as the castle glows red]

Bow: What is that?!

Swift Wind: Uh...this way!

[They make their way to the main room]

Glimmer: Adora!

Bow: Adora! We're here! Wake up!

Swift Wind: I think I can reach her. Hold on. [horn glows as he focuses on entering Adora's mind]

Glimmer: [worriedly] Swift Wind?

Bow: [nervously] Uh...Glimmer?

[spider robots chitter and squeal nearby, both Glimmer and Bow scream]


[Crystal Castle, Adora's mind]

[Adora gasps when the room around her glitches]

Light Hope: [Distorted, pitch shifting randomly] The Horde is hurting us. Balance Etheria.

Adora: [desperately, panicking] Light Hope? Light Hope, come back! I don't--I don't know what to do.

Swift Wind: [disembodied, hauntingly] Adoraa...[normally] Adora!

Adora: Our horse?

Swift Wind: Once again, I'm no one's horse. I'm Swift Wind.

Adora: [shocked] You can talk?

Swift Wind: Yes, I can talk.

Adora: [still shocked] You can talk?

Swift Wind: I can see now why you're friends with Bow and Glimmer. They need your help, which is why I'm here. So....which way's the exit?

Adora: I don't know. Light Hope disappeared and I-I don't know if I should go back.

Swift Wind: What do you mean?

Adora: Light Hope said if I leave here, I'll make things worse. She's right. Everyone will be better off if I just stay far away from them. It's-It's for the greater good.

Swift Wind: [deadpans] Well, that's just stupid.

Adora: [incredulous] What? No, it's not.

Swift Wind: Adora, I've had the ability to form complex thought for like...a week, and even I know you can't help anyone by hiding. Where would all the horses I freed from their barns be if I just sat in a pasture and moped?

Adora: [scoffing] I am not moping...

[Swift Wind blusters]

Adora: I'm not! I hurt people, I ruined my friends' lives!

Swift Wind: If that's true, then why are Bow and Glimmer here trying to rescue you?

[Hologram of Bow and Glimmer fighting off the spiders and holding Adora in reality]

Swift Wind: Bow and Glimmer are risking their lives. Not because you're She-Ra, but because you're their friend. What good is all your power if you don't use it to help the people that you love?

Adora: ...I'm not Mara. I'm not the She-Ras of the past. I didn't do this to fulfill some destiny. I became She-Ra to help others. My attachments, my friends, are a part of who I am.

Swift Wind: So. Are you staying? Or going?

Adora: Let's go.


Glimmer: [yelling in happiness] Adora! You're back!

Bow: [Voice cracking, shouting] Adora! Spiders!

[The spiders squeal]

Adora: For the honor...of Grayskull!

[She-Ra transformation]

[She-Ra stabs into the spiders, grunting]

[Bow, Glimmer and Swift Wind laugh and neigh in happiness]

[The door to the castle opens and they charge out into the blizzard, Swift Wind neighing and She-Ra cutting their path through the forest; a tree falling causes everyone to gasp]

She-Ra: Now, Swifty!

Swift Wind: Hold on!

[Everyone shouts as Swift Wind ascends past the clouds]

Bow: Guys, look!

[Lightning crackles]

Glimmer: It's not just the woods...it's...

Adora: It's the entire world.

Glimmer: [gasps] Bright Moon. Swift Wind, hurry!

[Swift Wind neighs as lightning crackles behind them]


[The Fright Zone]

[Lightning strikes frequently near the building housing the Black Garnet and the energy erupting from it]

Scorpia: Wow...[gasps, fearful] What do you think it's doing?

Catra: I don't know. But I can work with this.
