Adora,"   . Hey, princess. You looking at me? ",1,01
Woman over PA," All squadrons, report to training area immediately for evaluation.",1,01
Adora,  Psst. Anyone seen Catra?,1,01
Lonnie, ,1,01
Adora,  Not again.,1,01
Unknown Blue Horde Member," At attention, cadets. Your simulation is about to begin. Here's your scenario. You'll be passing through the treacherous Whispering Woods to reach the heart of the rebel insurgency, Bright Moon.",1,01
Kyle, ,1,01
Unknown Blue Horde Member, Your mission is to defeat the Queen of the Princesses and liberate Bright Moon in Lord Hordak's name. Where's Catra?,1,01
Adora, She will be here. I promise.,1,01
Unknown Blue Horde Member," Mm-hmm. The Whispering Woods is full of princesses.  Vicious, violent instigators.They will take you out if given the chance. Don't give it to them. Good luck, recruits.",1,01
Adora, Watch out!,1,01
Kyle," Oh, no, no, no, no, no!",1,01
Adora," Come on, this way.",1,01
Catra, ,1,01
Kyle,"  Aw, dang it.",1,01
Adora," Seriously, Kyle?",1,01
Lonnie, Bra-vo.,1,01
Lonnie," Seriously, Kyle?",1,01
Adora, Run!,1,01
Lonnie, Adora!,1,01
Adora,  ,1,01
Adora, ,1,01
Catra," Hey, Adora. How's it hanging?",1,01
Adora," Catra. Did you really show up late and let us do all the hard parts? That is low, even for you.",1,01
Catra," Aw. You know nothing's too low for me. . Now come on, you look stupid hanging down there.",1,01
Woman over PA, Training exercise successfully completed.,1,01
Catra," .  You should've seen your face. You were like, ""Aah, no! Betrayal.""",1,01
Adora,"  Come on, Catra. We're senior cadets now. I can't believe you're still pulling such childish, immature-- Is that a mouse?!",1,01
Catra, What!? Where!?,1,01
Adora, . Are you ever going to not fall for that?,1,01
Catra, I don't know. Are you ever going to let it go? That was one time.,1,01
Adora," I know, but for some reason it's always funny.",1,01
Shadow Weaver, Adora.,1,01
Adora, Shadow Weaver.,1,01
Shadow Weaver, You have done well. You've completed your training course in record time.,1,01
Adora," Uh, well, that wasn't just me. You know, Catra did, too.",1,01
Shadow Weaver," Ah, yes. How someone as unmotivated as you completed the course in that time, I'll never know.",1,01
Catra," Always serving up those pep talks, huh, Shadow Weaver?",1,01
Shadow Weaver," Silence. Do not be flippant with me, cadet.",1,01
Catra, Sorry Shadow Weaver.,1,01
Shadow Weaver," Adora, walk with me... Adora.",1,01
Shadow Weaver, Lord Hordak has been watching you. He thinks you are a fine candidate for Force Captain.,1,01
Adora, Really? Force Captain? Lord Hordak said that about me?,1,01
Shadow Weaver," Oh yes. He sees great promise in you. In fact, he has elected you the honor of leading a squadron in the invasion of the rebel Fortress of Thaymor.",1,01
Adora, Thaymor? You mean we're finally seeing active duty?,1,01
Shadow Weaver, You are seeing active duty.,1,01
Adora," But I'll be able to bring my team along, right?",1,01
Shadow Weaver, Your team is not ready. They'll only slow you down.,1,01
Adora," Shadow Weaver, with respect, they've been training hard for this, too. And Catra, all she wants is to get out there and prove herself.",1,01
Shadow Weaver," Then she should have worked harder to prove herself to me. This is what I raised you for, Adora. Now is your chance to prove yourself. I saw talent in you the moment I found you as an orphan child and took you in. Is this not what you've wanted since you were old enough to want anything?",1,01
Adora, Yes.,1,01
Shadow Weaver," With you at the forefront, we will crush the Bright Moon Rebellion once and for all. Do not disappoint me.",1,01
Angella, Send her in.,1,01
Glimmer, Your Majesty.,1,01
Angella, I'm told you disobeyed orders and led the Rebellion into a dangerous combat situation after you were ordered to retreat.,1,01
Glimmer, I was trying to protect a village from falling into The Horde's grasp.,1,01
Angella, You were reckless and put yourself and the other rebels in danger.,1,01
Glimmer," Fighting is supposed to be dangerous! How are we going to hold our own against The Horde if we keep retreating? Pretty soon, we won't have anything left to defend.",1,01
Angella," I'm growing tired of your back-talking, Commander Glimmer.",1,01
Glimmer, Why did you even make me a commander if you won't let me fight?,1,01
Angella, That's enough! You're grounded!,1,01
Glimmer,  Mom!,1,01
Angella, You heard me!,1,01
Glimmer, You never let me do anything!,1,01
Angella, We are not having this discussion tonight. You are embarrassing me in front of my royal court.,1,01
Glimmer," Oh, I'm embarrassing you?",1,01
Angella, Go to your room!,1,01
Glimmer, I'm going!,1,01
Angella, ,1,01
Adora, ,1,01
Catra," What'd she say? Hey, what's this?",1,01
Adora, Hey! Give it back.,1,01
Catra, No way. You've been promoted?,1,01
Adora," Well, kind of. I mean, yeah, I guess. Heh. But it's not a big deal.",1,01
Catra," Are you kidding? That is awesome. We're gonna see the world and conquer it. Adora, I need to blow something up. ",1,01
Adora, Umm..,1,01
Catra, What?,1,01
Adora, Shadow Weaver says you're not coming.,1,01
Catra, What? My time was just as good as yours today. What is her problem with me?,1,01
Adora," I mean, you are kind of disrespectful.",1,01
Catra, Why should I respect her? She's just bitter that she doesn't have any real power that doesn't come from Hordak and everyone knows it. I guess it sure must be easy being a people pleaser like you.,1,01
Adora," I am not a pe-- Catra, wait. ",1,01
Adora," Look, I'm sorry. I didn't even think you wanted to be a Force Captain.",1,01
Catra," I don't. Here, take your stupid badge.",1,01
Adora," Come on, Catra. This is what I have been working for my entire life. I was hoping you could be, I don't know, happy for me.",1,01
Catra," Ugh, whatever. It's not like I even care. I just wanna get out of this dump at some point before I die of boredom. I wonder what's even outside the Fright Zone anyway.",1,01
Adora, Why don't we go find out?,1,01
Catra, I take it all back. You're officially awesome. I can't believe you actually stole a skiff.,1,01
Adora, Borrowed. Please don't make me regret this.,1,01
Catra," I've always wanted to drive one of these things. Here, gimme.",1,01
Adora," Whoa, there. Save us enough fuel to get back.",1,01
Catra, That's a problem for future Adora and Catra.,1,01
Catra and Adora, I'm driving. I want it.,1,01
Catra, Can't have it! ,1,01
Catra, Let me.,1,01
Adora, Give me. I'm doing it.,1,01
Catra, Adora. I want it.,1,01
Adora," No, I've got it.",1,01
Adora, Catra!,1,01
Catra, What is it?,1,01
Adora," I think this must be the Whispering Woods. They say there are strange, old monsters in there, an- and the trees move when you're not looking. Every Horde squadron they've sent in there has never come out again.",1,01
Catra, Let's go in.,1,01
Adora," Wait, what? ",1,01
Catra, Woo-hoo!  ,1,01
Adora," Catra, slow down! Catra, tree! Tree! ",1,01
Catra, Adora!,1,01
Adora,  ,1,01
Adora, Catra? Huh? Whoa. Cool.,1,01
Adora, ,1,01
Female voice, Balance must be restored. Etheria must seek a hero.,1,01
Female voice," Adora, Adora.",1,01
Catra," Hey, Adora? Adora!",1,01
Adora, Catra? What happened?,1,01
Catra, You fell out of the skiff after you drove it into a tree.,1,01
Adora," No, you drove it into a tree.",1,01
Catra," Ah, up for debate. Come on, let's go.",1,01
Adora, Wait. Where is it? Where'd it go?,1,01
Catra, What?,1,01
Adora," Ther- There was a sword. It was right here. I tried to touch it, but it got really bright.",1,01
Catra," Are you brain damaged? Don't be brain damaged. Oh, Shadow Weaver's gonna kill me.",1,01
Adora," I'm not brain damaged. It was here, I saw it.",1,01
Catra," Well, there's nothing here now. So, come on, let's go.",1,01
Glimmer," ""Dear Mom, I know you'll never read this, but I have to say it somewhere. I feel like you... don't respect me.   Watch it! You almost hit me!",1,01
Bow," Hey, Glimmer.",1,01
Glimmer," Shh! Bow, what are you doing here?",1,01
Bow, What did you say? Come down here.,1,01
Glimmer," I can't, I'm grounded.",1,01
Bow, What?,1,01
Glimmer, I'm grounded.,1,01
Bow, ...What?,1,01
Glimmer, I'm... grounded.,1,01
Bow, ,1,01
Glimmer,  I'm so mad at my mom.,1,01
Bow, Is this about the siege on Elberon?,1,01
Glimmer," I was just trying to defend another one our villages from falling into The Horde's Clutches. She stationed me all the way out here because it's too remote to ever get attacked, but then it did, and it was my one chance to prove that I can do this. But she acts like I can't do anything because I'm just a princess. ",1,01
Bow," That doesn't make any sense. Everyone here is a princess. I'm, like, the only one who's not a princess.",1,01
Glimmer,  Tell that to my mom.,1,01
Bow," Hey, where does this go?",1,01
Glimmer, Bottom drawer.,1,01
Bow," Anyway, your mom might have a point. Only reason you got out of there is because of your teleportation powers, and, let's face it, they don't always work that well.",1,01
Glimmer," Looking for support here, Bow!",1,01
Bow," I'm just saying, if you wanna prove yourself, it's gonna take more than running recklessly into any old battle. Luckily, I've got just the thing. Check this out. I detected a piece of First Ones tech in the Whispering Woods. A pretty powerful one, too, by the size of these readings. If you find this one and bring it back, your mom is bound to be impressed.",1,01
Glimmer, Did you forget I'm grounded?,1,01
Angella, Glimmer? Are you in there?,1,01
Glimmer, Uh...,1,01
Bow, Ah!,1,01
Angella, Glimmer?,1,01
Glimmer," Everything's fine, Mom.",1,01
Angella, Is someone else in there? I heard voices.,1,01
Glimmer, No one else is in here. Can you please just leave me alone?,1,01
Angella," I don't appreciate your tone right now, young lady.",1,01
Glimmer, What tone?,1,01
Angella, That attitude of yours is never gonna help you know.,1,01
Glimmer," Mom, you always tell me what to do-",1,01
Angella, You cannot act that way!,1,01
Glimmer, -And that's not fair!,1,01
Glimmer, I'm in.,1,01
Adora, ,1,01
Female Voice, Adora. Adora. Adora!,1,01
Adora, ,1,01
Catra," Hey, where are you going?",1,01
Adora, Back to the woods. There's something I need to figure out.,1,01
Catra, What? You're not--,1,01
Catra, What is wrong with you? You've been acting weird since we got back. Are you sure you're not brain damaged?,1,01
Adora," Look Catra, I know I saw something out there. It's ju- I just need to get another look. It feels important somehow.",1,01
Catra, Sounds good. Let's go.,1,01
Adora, No. I don't want you getting in trouble on my behalf. Just cover for me okay? I'll be back before anyone knows I'm gone.,1,01
Catra, Adora! Adora!,1,01
Bow, Come on! Come on!,1,01
Glimmer, Uh! Please tell me we're not lost!,1,01
Bow," No, this thing is just acting up. Looks like it's being overloaded by the tech's signal. We must be getting close!",1,01
Glimmer, Uhh... I think it's that way.,1,01
Bow," What makes you say that? Oh, yeah. That'll do it.",1,01
Adora," What are you doing out here, Adora? Catra's right, this is crazy. There's no sword, you just got hit on the head a little too hard. You should just go back home and forget about all of this.",1,01
Glimmer," Bow, just let me lead the way, okay?",1,01
Bow, The light came from the edge of the forest.,1,01
Glimmer," Yes, you saw the light. It's this way.",1,01
Bow, The trackpad says otherwise.,1,01
Glimmer, It's this way--,1,01
Bow and Glimmer, ,1,01
Adora, ,1,01
Glimmer, Horde soldier!,1,01
Bow, I see her!,1,01
Bow and Glimmer, ,1,01
Adora,  ,1,01
Glimmer," Bow, catch.",1,01
Adora, Give me the sword.,1,01
Adora, Get off. Stand down. I don't wanna hurt you.,1,01
Glimmer, Since when do Horde soldiers not want to hurt anyone?,1,01
Adora, What?,1,01
Female voice," Hello, Adora.",1,01
Adora, Who are you? What's going on?,1,01
Female voice," My name is Light Hope. I have been waiting a long time for you, but I could not reach you until you forged your connection with the sword.",1,01
Adora, You sent the sword?,1,01
Light Hope," The sword is meant for you. Etheria has need of you, Adora. Will you answer its call? Will you fight for the honor of Grayskull?",1,01
Adora, What are you talking about? What-- What is-- What's Grayskull? You're not making any sense! I don't understand!,1,01
Light Hope, You will.,1,01
Adora, Wait!,1,01
Adora, ,1,01
Bow, Hey! She's awake.,1,01
Adora, What happened?,1,01
Glimmer," Quiet, Horde spy, I ask the questions. How did you make it this far into the Whispering Woods?",1,01
Adora, I just walked in. And I'm not a spy.,1,01
Glimmer," Sure, sure. You just so happened to find yourself in the Whispering Woods, like you just so happened to try and steal our sword.",1,01
Adora, It's not yours. I found it first.,1,01
Glimmer," The Whispering Woods is under the Rebellion's protection. You were lucky to make it as far as you did. Come on, Bow. Let's get this spy back to Bright Moon where she can be interrogated properly. This is perfect. Not only do we First Ones tech for the rebellion, we've also captured a Horde spy. My mom's gonna be so impressed. Now come on, on your feet.",1,01
Bow," You positive we're going the right way, Glimmer?",1,01
Glimmer," I know what I'm doing, Bow. Can you please just trust me for once?",1,01
Bow," You know I always trust you, but I'm starting to get a little freaked out. I mean, I pretty much grew up in these woods and I've never even seen this part of them. I've heard stories about weird stuff out here.",1,01
Glimmer," It's fine, okay? Just let me figure this out.",1,01
Bow," Okay! Touchy. Sorry about her. Usually she's really nice. Not much for talking, huh?",1,01
Adora, I prefer not to swap pleasantries with my captors.,1,01
Bow, Fair. Suit yourself.,1,01
Adora," You know she's a princess, right? How can you follow her? Princesses are a dangerous threat to everyone on Etheria.",1,01
Bow, Is that what Hordak told you?,1,01
Adora, Well I thought it was just common knowledge. They're violet instigators who don't even know how to control their powers.,1,01
Glimmer, ,1,01
Bow," You've never actually met a princess, have you?",1,01
Adora,"  Well, maybe not in person, but...",1,01
Glimmer, ,1,01
Adora, What happened to this place.,1,01
Glimmer, Don't play dumb with me. I bet you were part of the raiding party that did this.,1,01
Adora, What are you talking about? The Horde didn't do this.,1,01
Glimmer," Oh yeah? You're a heartless destroyer, just like all the rest of your people.",1,01
Adora, I'm not a destroyer. Hordak says we're doing what's best for Etheria. We're trying to make things better. More orderly.,1,01
Glimmer," This is what's best for Etheria? Ever since The Horde got here, they've been poisoning our land, burning our cities, destroying everything in their path. And you're a part of it! How's that for orderly?",1,01
Adora, This doesn't make any sense. The Horde would never do something like this.,1,01
Bow," Did you really not know any of this? I mean, your army is called the Evil Horde.",1,01
Adora, Who calls us that?,1,01
Bow, ...Everybody!,1,01
Adora, The Horde rescued me when I was a baby and gave me a home. They're my family. You-- you don't know them like I do.,1,01
Bow, Maybe you don't know them like you think you do.,1,01
Glimmer,  There's something out there. Something big.,1,01
Bow, How big?,1,01
Bow," So, pretty big then.",1,01
Bow, Watch out!,1,01
Glimmer, ,1,01
Glimmer, ,1,01
Adora," Hey, bug brain! Come on, Magic Sword. Oh, where's a blinding flash of light when you need one? ",1,01
Light Hope, Adora. Adora. Adora.,1,01
Light Hope, Will you fight for the honor of Grayskull?,1,01
, .. honor of Grayskull?,1,01
Adora, For the honor of Grayskull!,1,01
Bow, Glimmer?,1,02
Glimmer," Yeah, I see her, Bow.",1,02
Bow, Okay. I wanted to make sure it wasn't just me.,1,02
Adora,   Huh?,1,02
Glimmer, Stay where you are!,1,02
Adora, What did you do to me?,1,02
Glimmer, What do you mean what did 'I' do to you?,1,02
Adora, I didn't know being a princess was contagious!,1,02
Bow," Okay, okay, everyone, calm down! Wanna tell us how you did that?",1,02
Adora," I didn't do anything. All I did was pick up the sword, and then, woosh, I'm in a tiara!",1,02
Glimmer, I don't care how she did it. We just have to make sure she never does it again!,1,02
Bow, Do it again! Do it again!,1,02
Glimmer,  Bow!,1,02
Bow, Do what you did before.,1,02
Adora, I don't know what I did before!,1,02
Glimmer, No time. We have to go.,1,02
Adora, What is this place?,1,02
Bow," No idea, but in there's gotta be better than out here. ",1,02
Glimmer," Everyone, grab on, I can get us in there!",1,02
Bow," Glimmer, no! You've never teleported three people before.",1,02
Glimmer, Do you have a better idea?,1,02
Adora, What's written on this door? It looks like some kind of password.,1,02
Bow, You can read that?,1,02
Adora, You can't?,1,02
Bow, What's it say?,1,02
Adora," Uh, ""Eternia.""",1,02
Glimmer," Oh, come on!",1,02
Bow," So, Horde soldier, have you always been able to read First Ones' writing?",1,02
Glimmer, Wanna tell us what exactly is going on here?,1,02
Adora, I told you I don't know I just read the word on the door.,1,02
Glimmer," Right...  You read a word in a language that no one's spoken for a thousand years, and the door just opened into a mysterious ancient ruin. Sure.",1,02
Adora, You think I did this on purpose? You think I wanted to be a princess? Princesses are monsters.,1,02
Glimmer, Monsters? You're the monster!,1,02
Bow," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Glimmer, she did save us.",1,02
Glimmer," I don't care! We can't just trust her, Bow. Or have you forgotten everything the Horde's done to us? The people we're lost.  We need to find another way out of here and get her back to Bright Moon as soon as possible. My mother will know what to do with her.",1,02
Bow," Hey, so, thanks for saving us from that bug thing back there when you could've escaped instead.",1,02
Adora," Okay, well I didn't save you. I just wanted to get the sword, okay?",1,02
Bow, Are you sure it's not because you secretly like us?,1,02
Adora,  Wh--? I don't like you. You're my captors.,1,02
Bow, Sure.,1,02
Bow," Thanks for saving us anyway. I'm Bow, by the way.",1,02
Adora, Adora.,1,02
Bow," ""Adora."" Ah. Weird name for a Horde soldier.",1,02
Adora, Is it?,1,02
Glimmer,  For the honor of Grayskull.,1,02
Bow, What are we doing?,1,02
Glimmer," Nothing! I mean, uhh.. Look at these carvings. I think this might be a First Ones' ruin.",1,02
Adora, What's a First One?,1,02
Glimmer, You've never heard of the First Ones?,1,02
Bow," The First Ones are the original settlers of Etheria. They disappeared a thousand year ago, but they left behind a lot of old ruins and technology. Like this place.",1,02
Adora," So, what happened to them?",1,02
Bow, No one knows. They just disappeared. The Horde didn't tell you about them?,1,02
Adora, Seems like there's a lot the Horde didn't tell me.,1,02
Glimmer, Ugh. How do we get out of here?,1,02
Bow,"  It'll take forever to find a way out at this rate.  Hey! Wanna turn on some lights, Adora?",1,02
Adora, I don't know how to do that.,1,02
Bow," Maybe there's a magic word. Ooh, what's the First Ones' word for ""lights""?",1,02
Adora, I don't know. I'm not magic.,1,02
Glimmer," Obviously. Everyone, stand back.",1,02
Bow," Uh, Glimmer? Maybe you should take it easy. We're a long way from Bright Moon. It'll be awhile until you can recharge.",1,02
Glimmer, Bow!,1,02
Adora, You have to recharge your powers?,1,02
Glimmer," Can we not talk about this in front of the Horde soldier? Now, stand back.  ",1,02
Adora, Whoa. ,1,02
Glimmer, ,1,02
Bow, Wow. Are you okay?,1,02
Glimmer," I'm fine, Bow.",1,02
Bow, Oh hey! That's you!,1,02
Adora, What? That doesn't look anything like me.,1,02
Bow," No, I mean, the other you. The scary one in the cape.",1,02
Adora, That was me?,1,02
Bow," You can read that inscription, right? What's it say?",1,02
Adora," It says... ""She-Ra.""",1,02
Light Hope," Greetings, administrator.",1,02
Adora, What is this thing?,1,02
Light Hope, What is your query?,1,02
Bow, I think it's some kind of ancient hologram.,1,02
Light Hope, What is your query?,1,02
Bow, Uh... Hi. What is this place? How do we get out of here?,1,02
Light Hope, What is your query?,1,02
Bow, Welp. She's broken.,1,02
Glimmer, She's old. I'm surprised any of this stuff still works at all.,1,02
Light Hope, Administrator not detected. Lockdown initiated.,1,02
Glimmer, I didn't do it!,1,02
Bow," No. No. No lockdown! No lockdown! Adora, you gotta get it to stop!",1,02
Adora, What makes you think I can?,1,02
Light Hope, Query not recognized.,1,02
Bow, There's gotta be a password or something!,1,02
Adora," Uh, stop it! Uh, Eternia! Eternia! Give me the sword!",1,02
Glimmer, What? No!,1,02
Adora," We need the scary lady in the cape. I don't know how, but she's the key to this place, so maybe she can get us out.",1,02
Glimmer, You're a Horde soldier. I'm not giving you the sword.,1,02
Adora," Eternia! Uh, cape! Uh... She-Ra!",1,02
Glimmer, Hold on!,1,02
Bow," Glimmer, no!",1,02
Bow, Glimmer!,1,02
Bow, Glimmer? Glimmer!,1,02
Glimmer,  Did it work?,1,02
Bow,"  Yeah, it worked. Barely. Are you alright?",1,02
Glimmer, I'm fine.  I think I used too much power getting us out of there.,1,02
Bow," I don't know who could've predicted that... Oh, right. Me.",1,02
Glimmer, Bow...,1,02
Bow, Like an hour ago.,1,02
Glimmer, Bow!,1,02
Bow," Sorry. I'm just glad you're okay. No more teleporting for awhile, okay. You could really hurt yourself.",1,02
Glimmer," I'm fine, okay? Let's just get back to Bright Moon so I can recharge already. Why are you still here?",1,02
Adora, What?,1,02
Glimmer, Bow and I are hardly a crack security team. You could've escaped at any time. Why didn't you?,1,02
Adora," I just-- I wanna figure out what's happening to me, and if I go back to the Fright Zone, then I'll never know. I never knew where I came from or who my family was. Shadow Weaver said it didn't matter who I was before, that-- that I was nothing before Hordak took me in. There's always been a part of me that I don't know anything about an-- and all of this, it feels familiar somehow. I don't know how else to explain it.",1,02
Bow," Glimmer's mom knows more about First Ones' tech than anyone. She'll know what's going on with you and the sword for sure. So, if you want your questions answered, stick with us?",1,02
Glimmer, Let's go. There should be a village a few miles from here. They'll be able to give us a ride back to Bight Moon. We've wasted too much time already.,1,02
Shadow Weaver," For the last time, where is Adora?",1,02
Catra," For the last time, I don't know. You think I keep her on a leash?",1,02
Shadow Weaver, I know you're lying. You two are close. She would never depart without telling you.,1,02
Catra," Then I guess she let us both down, huh?",1,02
Shadow Weaver, Have it your way. I already know where she is. We've been tracking her.,1,02
Catra," Uh, then why did you ask me?",1,02
Shadow Weaver, Because you are going to bring her back.,1,02
Catra, I don't think so. ,1,02
Shadow Weaver, Your insolence will not protect her. You will do as I ask.,1,02
Catra," Oh, yeah? Or what?",1,02
Shadow Weaver, Or you will suffer the consequences in her place.,1,02
Glimmer," Okay, the jacket comes off.",1,02
Adora, Why?,1,02
Glimmer," If the villagers see a Horde soldier, they'll freak out. We gotta fix all this.",1,02
Adora, I feel ridiculous.,1,02
Bow, That’s ‘cause you need something to tie it all together.,1,02
Adora, I don't like it.,1,02
Glimmer," Point is, you don't look like a Horde soldier. Just keep a low profile. We'll be in and out.",1,02
Adora, What is this?,1,02
Bow, It's a festival. Like a big party. You don't have parties in the Fright Zone?,1,02
Adora," Oh, right, parties. I mean, yeah, pfft, of course. I, uh-- I don't know what that is.",1,02
Bow, Ah!,1,02
Glimmer," Did you even hear me? I said, in and out!",1,02
Bow," She has never been to a party before, Glimmer! This is serious.",1,02
Bow," So, seriously? No parties ever?  What do you guys do on your birthday?",1,02
Adora, Huh?,1,02
Bow, No birthdays?! How is your life this sad?,1,02
Adora,  What is that?,1,02
Bow, That would be a horse.,1,02
Adora, It's majestic.,1,02
Bow, You wanna go meet it?,1,02
Adora, What? No! ,1,02
Bow," Come on, it's okay. See, he likes you.",1,02
Adora,  This is the best day of my life.,1,02
Glimmer, Bow,1,02
Bow," Come on, I know you like her, too.",1,02
Adora, What's going on?,1,02
Glimmer, It's the Horde!,1,02
Bow, Why are they here? The people of Thaymor aren't a threat.,1,02
Adora, Did you say Thaymor? This can't be Thaymor.,1,02
Glimmer, Did you know something about this?,1,02
Adora," No. I mean, yes. But there's a mistake. Thaymor's supposed to be a heavily fortified rebel fortress, not a civilian town!",1,02
Glimmer, Do you really think that matters to them?,1,02
Adora, This is a big mistake. I just need to talk to them. Get as many people out as you can. I'm sorry!,1,02
Glimmer, Adora!,1,02
Adora, Stop!,1,02
Catra, Adora!,1,02
Adora, Catra?,1,02
Catra, They let me drive a tank. Believe it?,1,02
Adora, I don't understand. Why are you here?,1,02
Catra," Uh, duh, we came to find you. ""Cover for me, Catra. No one will even  know I'm gone."" Did you just get immediately captured right after you snuck out--? What are you wearing?",1,02
Glimmer, Uh Bow! ,1,02
Bow, Hey!,1,02
Adora, There's no time. We have to stop this.,1,02
Catra, What? Why?,1,02
Adora, Look around. This is a civilian town. These aren't insurgents. They're innocent people.,1,02
Catra," Yeah, innocent people who kidnapped a Horde officer. Let's get back to the Fright Zone. Shadow Weaver is freaking out.  It'd be funny if she weren't such a terrible person.",1,02
Adora," Catra, no. I can't go back. Not until the Horde leaves this town alone. Help me.",1,02
Catra, What are you saying?,1,02
Adora," I’m saying, this is wrong. They've been lying to us, manipulating us. Hordak, Shadow Weaver, all of them.",1,02
Catra, Duh! Did ya just figure that out? Manipulation is Shadow Weaver's whole thing. She's been messing with our heads since we were kids.,1,02
Adora, How could you possibly be okay with that?,1,02
Catra," Because, it doesn't matter what they do. The two of us look out for each other. And soon we'll be calling the shots. Now, can we go home?",1,02
Adora, I'm not going home. Not after everything I've seen. Come with me. You don't have to go back there. We can fix this.,1,02
Catra," Are you kidding? You've known these people for, what, a couple hours? And you're just gonna throw everything away for them? Ugh. What happened to you?",1,02
Adora," I don't know. But I have to do something. I'm sorry, Catra!",1,02
Bow, Ah! I think that's all of them. What will we do?,1,02
Glimmer, There's nothing we can do. You're almost out of arrows and I'm almost out of magic.,1,02
Bow," You can't say that. You're Glimmer. You throw yourself into every fight, no matter how hopeless.",1,02
Glimmer," Ugh. Every decision I've made in the past day has almost gotten us killed. My mom's right, I'm not ready for this.",1,02
Bow," No. You are not giving up now. I’m sorry your mom doesn't see how strong you are. You can do this, Glimmer, and you’re not alone.",1,02
Glimmer, You're right. We need Adora.,1,02
Bow, Didn't she just sell us out to the Horde?,1,02
Glimmer, I don't think she did. We need to find her. She can help us. Just trust me. Okay?,1,02
Catra," Oh, man. That was a lot stronger than I thought. Are you okay?",1,02
Adora, Catra!,1,02
Catra, Sorry! It was a reflex.,1,02
Adora, Why are you doing this?,1,02
Catra," Because you left me. And if I don't bring you back, Shadow Weaver’s gonna have my head. So, enough with your weird little identity crisis and let's go home. Or do I need to zap you again? ",1,02
Adora, Glimmer?,1,02
Glimmer, Watch out!,1,02
Catra, Adora!,1,02
Adora, What are you doing? Why did you save me?,1,02
Glimmer, We need you. We need She-Ra. I should've given this back to you in the ruin. You could've saved us and I knew that. But I was stupid. And a jerk. And I'm sorry!,1,02
Adora, You're not a jerk. I'm the Horde soldier. How do you know you can trust me now?,1,02
Glimmer, I don't. But I hope I can. I feel like maybe you're here to help us.,1,02
Adora, For the honor of Grayskull!,1,02
Bow," It's been an honor serving beside you, Horsey.",1,02
Glimmer, Bow! Are you okay?,1,02
Bow, Is that Adora?,1,02
Glimmer, It's She-Ra.,1,02
Horde soldier, Retreat!,1,02
Adora, Catra...,1,02
Glimmer, You did it!,1,02
Adora, I did?,1,02
Glimmer, You saved us. You saved everyone!,1,02
Adora,  I did it. I turned against the Horde. I turned against the Horde!  I can't go back now. Where am I supposed to go?,1,02
Glimmer," Hey, hey. It's okay. You're with us now. C’mon, let's go home.",1,02
Bow," Best-friends squad! Wait, whose horse was this?",1,02
Bow," Hey, we made it.",1,03
Adora, Whoa.,1,03
Glimmer, Welcome to Bright Moon.,1,03
Adora, It’s so beautiful.,1,03
Glimmer," Okay, I just need to go in there, recharge, and deal with my mom.  This’ll be fun.",1,03
Glimmer," Uh, Bow? Maybe we should take Adora in the back way?",1,03
Bow," Oh, yeah. Good call.",1,03
Adora, What’s the back way?,1,03
Adora, This is the back way?,1,03
Bow," It might seem weird, but we totally come in this way all the time.",1,03
Bow," Oh! Hey, here. Why don’t you put this robe on? No reason.",1,03
Adora, You’re trying to hide me.,1,03
Bow,  What? No!,1,03
Angella, Glimmer! Where have you been?,1,03
Glimmer," Hey, mom.",1,03
Angella, All of Bright Moon has been worried sick. What were you thinking?,1,03
Glimmer, Mom!,1,03
Angella,  How could you be so selfish and disobedient?,1,03
Glimmer, ,1,03
Angella,  Glimmer.,1,03
Glimmer, ,1,03
Angella, Are you all right?,1,03
Glimmer," I’m fine, mom.",1,03
Angella, Don’t think you’re not still in trouble. You didn’t even take the time to charge up before you left?,1,03
Glimmer, I didn’t think I’d be gone that long.,1,03
Angella," Where did you go, anyway?",1,03
Glimmer," Okay. Bow and I found a piece of super powerful First Ones tech in the woods. We knew it would really help the Rebellion, so we went to get it and bring it back. But we got a little sidetracked. It was fine, though, and I totally had it under control. And while we were out there, we found something even better!",1,03
Angella, What did you find?,1,03
Glimmer, I can’t tell you yet. But you’re gonna love it. I promise!,1,03
Angella, Glimmer—,1,03
Glimmer, Ah! Just wait here. I’ll be right back.,1,03
Angella," We are not done talking about this, Glimmer. Glimmer!",1,03
Adora," Okay, I get it. I’m guessing the people of Bright Moon are gonna be a little less welcoming of a Horde soldier than you led me to believe.",1,03
Bow, Maybe a little.,1,03
Adora, How little?,1,03
Bow, Think pitchforks and torches.,1,03
Bow, It’s just that the people of Bright Moon have been really hurt by the Horde. Everyone here has lost someone in the war. You can’t blame them for being a little suspicious.,1,03
Adora, Sorry.,1,03
Bow," Hey, it’s not your fault. Once they get to know you, the people of Bright Moon are going to trust you just like Glimmer and I already—",1,03
Glimmer,"  I’m here! Okay, my mom’s on her way, but no one panic.",1,03
Adora, What?,1,03
Glimmer,  I said no one panic!,1,03
Glimmer," Don’t worry, she’ll love you. All you have to do is use the sword to transform into She-Ra before she gets here.",1,03
Bow," Wait, we’re jumping straight to She-Ra with your mom? Are you sure?",1,03
Glimmer," Yeah, I don’t think my mom is going to buy, “Hey mom, we found a Horde soldier. Can we keep her?”",1,03
Glimmer, My mom is gonna love She-Ra. We can ease her into the Horde stuff later.,1,03
Adora," Uh, Glimmer, look. I don’t know if I can just ‘turn on’ She-Ra. I’ve only done it when someone was in danger before, and it felt a little out-of-control last time. I’m still figuring out how all of this stuff works.",1,03
Glimmer," How hard can it be? Sword, magic words, poof! She-Ra!",1,03
Glimmer," Hey. You’re gonna do great, okay? Bow and I will go buy you some time. Just hang out here with the sword and think She-Ra thoughts. I believe in you!",1,03
Bow, ,1,03
Adora,"  Right. Okay, sword, it’s just you and me now. So, uh…let’s do this. ",1,03
Adora, For the honor of Gray—,1,03
Adora, Horsey! ,1,03
Adora, Oh! This is much better. There’s actually room to move around here.,1,03
Adora, Ready to see something cool?,1,03
Adora,  For the honor of Grayskull!,1,03
Adora," Okay, let’s try that again. For the honor of Grayskull!",1,03
Adora,  For the honor of Grayskull!,1,03
Adora,  For the honor of Grayskull!,1,03
Adora,  For the honor of Grayskull.,1,03
Adora,  For…the…honor…of…Grayskull.,1,03
Adora,  For the honor of Grayskull.,1,03
Adora,"  Honor of Grayskull, blah blah blah.",1,03
Adora," Oh, come on! Glimmer’s counting on me. Don’t leave me hanging here.",1,03
Adora, For the honor of Grayskull!,1,03
Adora," Horsey, no!",1,03
Adora," Horsey, it’s okay!",1,03
Crowd, ,1,03
Adora," No! No, wait! Horsey! Stop!",1,03
Adora,  Horsey!,1,03
Adora, Come back!,1,03
Woman,  Horde soldier…,1,03
Bright Moon Soldier, Horde Soldier!,1,03
Adora," Wait, you don’t understand. Stop! I’m not with the Horde. Just listen to me!",1,03
Woman 1,  Go! Get her!,1,03
Woman 2, Don’t let her get away!,1,03
Woman 1, Move!,1,03
Angella," For the last time, what is this grand surprise that I’m supposed to be so impressed with?",1,03
Glimmer," You’ll see it in just a minute, Mom. I promise.",1,03
Glimmer," Bow, can you go check and make sure that the surprise is ready for us?",1,03
Bow," You got in, Princess.",1,03
Angella,  I like that boy.,1,03
Gimmer," I know you do, Mom. And you’re gonna like this surprise even more. ",1,03
Bow,  So…problem.,1,03
Glimmer, What?,1,03
Woman, Your majesty. A horde spy has been discovered on the Bright Moon grounds. She attacked our troops with a sword and then fled with the help of a winged beast.,1,03
Angella, What did you do?!,1,03
Lonnie, I’m telling you. This new princess is no joke. She wiped the floor with our whole recon squad. Twelve feet tall at least! Took out every one of our machines with nothing but a sword.,1,03
Woman, Did you actually see her?,1,03
Lonnie," No. And it’s a good thing, too. We were lucky to get out of there alive.",1,03
Lonnie," Sure. You were the only one who saw her up close, and you didn’t even land a hit on her.",1,03
Lonnie, What? Did you freeze up?,1,03
Catra,  You think I’m scared of some princess? I could take her out whenever I want. I know her secret.,1,03
Lonnie,  Oh yeah?,1,03
Catra, ,1,03
Lonnie, And what’s that?,1,03
Catra,  Hmm. Like I’d tell you.,1,03
Lonnie," Easy, Catra. Adora’s not here to protect you anymore.",1,03
Adora,"  Stupid. You just had to go out there, even after Bow warned you about the pitchforks and torches.",1,03
Adora,  What do you want from me now? Haven’t I done enough for you?,1,03
Adora,  For the honor of Grayskull?,1,03
Adora,  What’s wrong with you?,1,03
Adora, Horsey? Is that you?,1,03
Razz, ,1,03
Razz," Hm? Did you hear something? Yes, I did, too. Who’s there?!",1,03
Adora,"  I, uh, didn’t mean to intrude. Um, but have you seen a flying horse around here?",1,03
Razz," Oh, Mara, dearie! Is that you? About time you got here. Come on now, there’s no time to waste. Let’s get going.",1,03
Adora,"  Uh, you were waiting for me?",1,03
Razz, [laughs[ We made plans to go berry-picking today.,1,03
Adora," Look, I’m sorry, but I think you’ve mistaken me for someone else. I don’t know who you are.",1,03
Razz," No, you don’t know Madame Razz, do you? You’re not quite the same. This is the wrong time for my Mara, isn’t it? Now you’ve got the sword, instead.",1,03
Adora," Wait, what?",1,03
Razz," Ah! Well, never mind. You’re here now, and there’s still berries to be picked.",1,03
Adora," Hey, uh, you’ve said something about the sword. Have you seen it before?",1,03
Razz,"  Don’t ask such silly questions, Mara. You know you bring that sword around here all the time.",1,03
Adora, I’m not—Okay. How long have you been living out here in the woods alone?,1,03
Razz," Alone? Me? Oh, no! I’m not alone. I’ve got Broom here, and my friend Loo-Kee, too! But he’s always hiding. ",1,03
Adora,"  Oh, good, she’s got imaginary friends.",1,03
Adora, Whoa.,1,03
Razz, Ah! Here we are.,1,03
Adora," I think I’ve seen a place like this before. This is a First Ones ruin, isn’t it?",1,03
Razz,  And the best place to pick fresh berries!,1,03
Adora," Hey, be careful up there! That thing’s not safe.",1,03
Razz,"  Oh, dearie me! That was quite a tumble, eh?",1,03
Adora, Stars?,1,03
Razz," Oh, we used to come here to look at the stars. Do you remember, Mara? They’re all gone now. What happened to the stars?",1,03
Adora, I’ve seen them before. I know all of this somehow.,1,03
Adora, What is this? What’s happening to me?,1,03
Razz, ,1,03
Adora," Look, I know you brought me here for a reason. If you know something about the sword, about me, you need to tell me!",1,03
Razz," I brought you here to pick berries, and your basket’s still empty. So, come on, silly.",1,03
Adora, Whoa! ,1,03
Catra, ,1,03
Shadow Weaver,  Catra!,1,03
Catra,  What do you want?,1,03
Shadow Weaver," Impertinent as always, I see. With such a grand failure under your belt, it would benefit you to show more respect, cadet.",1,03
Catra, I did exactly what you told me to do. You are the one who didn’t warn us there would be princesses there.,1,03
Shadow Weaver, Lies!,1,03
Shadow Weaver," I am out of patience to address your incompetence and your insubordination, cadet. You will answer to a higher power, Lord Hordak himself.",1,03
Adora,  Wait! Will you slow down?,1,03
Razz," Eh? What’s that, dearie? I don’t have my glasses; you’ll have to speak up.",1,03
Adora," Oh, I know you can hear me. I just—I need you to tell me what to do!",1,03
Razz,  How would Madame Razz know what you should do?,1,03
Adora," Look, I left my whole life behind, looking for answers about where I came from and who I’m supposed to be. The Rebellion hates me, and I can’t go back to the Horde. And I wanna do the right thing, but I don’t know what that is.",1,03
Adora, ,1,03
Razz," Ah, it’s the same old story, dearie. Wicked people destroy what they cannot control.",1,03
Adora, They can’t just do this!,1,03
Razz," Once, the princesses would have protected us. But these days, they—they stay in their castles, protecting only their own lands. Meanwhile, the Horde creeps ever closer.",1,03
Razz," You’re very like my Mara, you know? Brave, loyal, but afraid.",1,03
Adora, I’m not afraid.,1,03
Razz, Dearie… You ran into the woods and asked the first old lady you could find what you should do!,1,03
Razz," No one is going to make this easy for you, dearie. Stop waiting for someone to tell you what the right thing to do is.",1,03
Razz, You’re a smart girl. What do you think?,1,03
Adora, I think…this is wrong.,1,03
Adora, Horsey.,1,03
Razz, Huh?,1,03
Adroa,  For the honor of Grayskull.,1,03
Horde Soldier, Keep those lines taut.,1,03
Adora, ,1,03
Swift Wind, ,1,03
She-Ra, Turn off your machines and leave this place now!,1,03
Horde Soldier, It’s the princess. Get her!,1,03
Horde Soldier, Huh? Uh…,1,03
Razz, That’s my girl. ,1,03
Razz,"  Take that, you great lump! Razzle Dazzle!",1,03
She-Ra," Razz, no! You can’t be here!",1,03
Swift Wind, ,1,03
Razz, Woo-hoo!,1,03
Razz," Mara, dear!",1,03
Horde Soldier, Yeah!,1,03
Razz, Razzle Dazzle! ,1,03
Swift Wind, ,1,03
Razz," Hello, dearie.",1,03
Adora, Ow.,1,03
Razz, Swift Wind and I have been talking while you were asleep. He thanks you for coming to his rescue.,1,03
Adora, Swift Wind?,1,03
Razz," That’s what he prefers to be called. Also, he wanted me to make sure that you know that “Horsey” was a stupid name.",1,03
Razz, How do you feel?,1,03
Adora, I’m…I’m okay. I think I know what I need to do.,1,03
Adora," If the princesses won’t defend Etheria, then I will.",1,03
Adora, I need to get back to Bright Moon.,1,03
Razz," Ah, that’s the spirit, dearie!",1,03
Adora, Will I see you again?,1,03
Razz," If you need me, you will always know where to find me.",1,03
Razz,  Who was that girl?,1,03
Adora,"  Um…any chance I can get a ride back to Bright Moon, Swift Wind? Please?",1,03
Swift Wind, ,1,03
Adora, ,1,03
Swift Wind, ,1,03
Adora, Woo-hoo! ,1,03
Angella, How could you possibly think this was acceptable?!,1,03
Glimmer," Mom, you don’t understand! You’re not listening!",1,03
Angella, You’ve shown remarkably poor judgment! Allowing a Horde soldier into Bright Moon without telling me?,1,03
Bow," Your majesty, it’s not all her fault.",1,03
Angella," Bow, I think it’s time you went home. Glimmer and I have a lot to discuss.",1,03
Glimmer, Mom!,1,03
Angella, It can’t be.,1,03
Glimmer," I was trying to tell you. Mom, meet—",1,03
Angella, She-Ra.,1,03
She-Ra," Your Majesty, I’ve come to pledge myself to the Rebellion. But first, there’s something you should know.",1,03
Woman, She’s a Horde Soldier.,1,03
Glimmer," Mom, this is Adora.",1,03
Adora,"  I know you have no reason to trust me, Your Majesty. But I’ve seen for myself the atrocities the Horde has committed against the people of Etheria, and I’m ready to fight to stop them. If you give me the chance, I know I can help the Rebellion turn the tide of the war.",1,03
Angella,  I know the legend of the warrior the First Ones called She-Ra. They said she would return to us in the hour of our greatest need to bring balance to Etheria. I never thought she was anything more than a myth.,1,03
Angella," And yet you’re here now. And in the uniform of a Horde soldier, no less.",1,03
Angella, You would pledge to stand with us against those you once served?,1,03
Adora,  Yes.,1,03
Angella," Glimmer, you would vouch for her and take responsibility for her?",1,03
Glimmer, Yes.,1,03
Angella," Then rise. The Rebellion accepts your allegiance, She-Ra, Princess of Power.",1,03
Crowd,  She-Ra! She-Ra! She-Ra!,1,03
Glimmer,  Welcome to Bright Moon!,1,03
Bow,  But for real this time.,1,03
Shadow Weaver, Lord Hordak.  Kneel!,1,03
Hordak, Then you mean to tell me that you’re still down a Force Captain?,1,03
Shadow Weaver," Yes, my lord. But rest assured, nothing will stop us from finding Adora and bringing her back.",1,03
Hordak, No. You will elect another Force Captain and resume normal operations.,1,03
Shadow Weaver," But, my lord, Adora is the only viable candidate.",1,03
Hordak," You have Catra. Was she not your ward, as well?",1,03
Shadow Weaver, Catra has been nothing but a disappointment to me.,1,03
Hordak," If you have failed to condition her properly, you have no one but yourself to blame.",1,03
Shadow Weaver," But, my lord—",1,03
Hordak," Enough. I have made my decision. Rise, Force Captain Catra.",1,03
Hordak, Hmm.,1,03
Glimmer, This is awesome! I can't believe Mom agreed to let you stay in Bright Moon!,1,04
Adora," Yeah, awesome.",1,04
Glimmer," Okay. You've seen the dining room, throne room, portrait hall. So, the last stop on our grand tour is... your new room! Ta-da!",1,04
Glimmer," It's pretty standard. You've got your vanity, the bathroom, crystals, bell pull, tea nook, more crystals, bed, desk, and of course, the waterfall.",1,04
Adora, Is the waterfall for showering?,1,04
Glimmer," Ha! Good one, Adora. ""Waterfall for showering.""  I'm right down the hall if you need anything. Night.",1,04
Adora, Wait--,1,04
Adora," Okay. This is different than the Fright Zone, but I'm sure I'll get the hang of this in no time.  Help.",1,04
Adora,"  Come on, get flatter! No! Go back in! Go back in!   Glimmer? Glimmer? I think I killed the bed.   Ma'am! I mean, Your Majesty. Sir!  So, what are you doing up?",1,04
Angella," When I feel the cares of the day weighing upon me, I come here.",1,04
Adora, Who is that?,1,04
Angella, King Micah. My husband. He built the Rebellion with me. And he was one of the first casualties of The Horde.,1,04
Adora, Sorry. I didn't know.,1,04
Angella," Adora. My daughter believes you can help us. Glimmer has vouched for you despite your background. And because I greatly love my daughter, I am willing to give you a chance. Do not disappoint her.",1,04
Adora,  Glimmer! Are you okay?,1,04
Glimmer, What are you doing in here?,1,04
Adora," I'm sorry! I couldn't sleep in my room. I've never slept without any other people around. And then I ran into your mom, I think she doesn't like me.",1,04
Glimmer, What? My mom loves you.,1,04
Adora," Yeah, sure. She loves She-Ra.",1,04
Glimmer," Mom can be... a little intense, heh. But, our weekly meeting with the Rebellion Generals is today and you're invited. She wouldn't have invited you if she didn't like you.",1,04
Adora, Wow. Heh.,1,04
Glimmer, Come on. Meeting's about to start.,1,04
Adora," Uh, the chairs are still empty.",1,04
Glimmer," Those are for the other Etherian Princesses, but... none of them have been active members since I was a kid. The Rebellion had a big defeat years ago, and most of the old Princesses gave up. Now all the kingdoms keep to themselves, and the new Princesses do the same.",1,04
Bow, Other than Spinnerella and Netossa.,1,04
Adora, Ah.,1,04
Adora, What? What? I don't understand.,1,04
Angella, This is not your chair.,1,04
Glimmer, Sorry! First day. Won't happen again!,1,04
Adora,  What did I do?,1,04
Glimmer,  You sat in my dad's chair.,1,04
Adora,  Oh... Oh. I'm sorry.,1,04
Angella, I've asked you here because I've received a distress call from Princess Perfuma. The Horde is laying siege to her kingdom. She's asking Bright Moon for assistance. General?,1,04
Bright Moon General," Perfuma's kingdom, Plumeria, is located near the front lines.The Horde has set up camp in their territory, cutting off their main supply route",1,04
Angella, Bright Moon will provide food and humanitarian aid.,1,04
Glimmer,  I have a better idea. We can--,1,04
Angella," Fight the Horde? Glimmer, you propose this idea every meeting.",1,04
Glimmer," No! I was going to say, let's use aggressive fist-to-face sparkles.",1,04
Angella," I said, no, Glimmer. Now sit down!",1,04
Adora," You should send me, Glimmer, and Bow to lead the relief mission.You can send me as She-Ra. I'll make sure everyone gets there safely and protect Bow and Glimmer if the Horde attacks. I promise, I won't disappoint you.",1,04
Angella,"  Very well. You will deliver food and supplies to Plumeria, and under no circumstances will you engage the Horde. You leave at dawn.",1,04
Kyle,  I give up! I give up!,1,04
Lonnie,"  Quit playing around, Kyle! Where's Catra? She's supposed to be here.",1,04
Catra," Not anymore, cadet Lonnie.",1,04
Lonnie, Why aren't you dressed?,1,04
Catra," Oh, Lonnie, Lonnie... sweet, dumb, Lonnie. ",1,04
Lonnie, They made you Force Captain?,1,04
Kyle," Congrats, Catra! ",1,04
Catra," Hordak knows a good thing when he sees it. Now that I'm in charge, Shadow Weaver won't be the only one...Uh...",1,04
Catra," What do ya need, Shadow Weaver? Ooh, are you giving me my first mission?",1,04
Shadow Weaver, You will explain how you lost Force Captain Adora.,1,04
Catra,"  Ugh, I've told you everything I know about Adora! ",1,04
Shadow Weaver, I know you're lying. You have to be lying. What happened to Adora? What did you do?,1,04
Catra, What did I do? She left us! She left me! You ever think Adora's not as loyal as you thought?,1,04
Shadow Weaver," I will learn the truth, Catra, even if I have to drag it from your--",1,04
Shadow Weaver, Out of my way!,1,04
Glimmer, Wow. Mom didn't say anything about all the plants dying.,1,04
Bow," I don't think she knows. Wait, where's Adora?",1,04
Glimmer, Are you gonna be She-Ra the entire time we're here?,1,04
She-Ra," I told Queen Angella I would. Besides, people like me better as She-Ra.  Could Adora do this? ",1,04
Glimmer, Hmm. Yep. Very useful to our mission.,1,04
Bow," Hey, guys. What is that?",1,04
She-Ra, Must be coming from the Horde camp.,1,04
Perfuma, You're here!,1,04
Glimmer, Princess Perfuma. I'm Commander Glimmer of--,1,04
Bow," Ooh, I get a hat.",1,04
Perfuma,"  Oh, my. Everyone, come quick! It's, Oh, it's… It's…  Look! The universe has heard our pleas and sent the legendary She-Ra to help us save our home.",1,04
She-Ra,  We heard about the blockade and we've come to help. We brought food and supplies for you.,1,04
Perfuma," Welcome to Plumeria, She-Ra.",1,04
She-Ra," Um, Glimmer, what's happening?",1,04
Perfuma," Come with me, I'll show you around. You're gonna love it.",1,04
Perfuma," Our people have lived here for thousands of years. We're known for our beautiful flowers, our majestic trees. And this is the Heart-Blossom, the center of our kingdom, and the source of all my magical powers.",1,04
Bow, At least this tree is fine. What happened to everything else?,1,04
Perfuma," We're going through a little rough patch, but I'm sure the universe will right itself soon.",1,04
Glimmer, Everything is dead or dying.,1,04
Perfuma," Look, the blight hit right after the Horde arrived. We don't know why, and nothing I do stops it. But we don't dwell on the negative. Look at the positive. The Heart-Blossom is still healthy, and the She-Ra is here, and the celebration's about to begin.",1,04
She-Ra, Celebration? ,1,04
Shadow Weaver, You will not refuse me!,1,04
Hordak, Shadow Weaver.,1,04
Shadow Weaver, Lord Hordak!,1,04
Hordak, You have disobeyed my orders.,1,04
Shadow Weaver," I've done no such thing, Lord Hordak. My will is your will.",1,04
Hordak, Then explain to me why you've requisitioned more troops to look for one missing soldier. A soldier I ordered you to give up on.,1,04
Shadow Weaver, Finding Adora is crucial to the Horde's mission—,1,04
Hordak,"  Our mission is to kill the Whispering Woods so we can march on Bright Moon. Our mission is to destroy the princesses and their ridiculous rebellion. You are distracted, Shadow Weaver. Our ground troops demand your full attention. The siege on Plumeria has carried on for too long. You will give the order to increase power until victory is achieved. And never forget, I gave you your magical power and at my slightest whim,  I can take it away.  Understand?",1,04
Shadow Weaver," Of course, Lord Hordak.",1,04
She-Ra," No, no, no, it's okay. You need this food more than we do.",1,04
Plumerian elder, Nonsense. It is our honor to serve the She-Ra.,1,04
She-Ra," No, no, no, it's okay. You need this food more than we do.",1,04
Plumerian elder, Nonsense. It is our honor to serve the She-Ra.,1,04
Perfuma, We are so honored to have you.,1,04
Plumerian Citizen 1, Whoa. That's She-Ra.,1,04
Perfuma," Yes, I know. The She-Ra, right? I'm so happy that after all these centuries of being gone, you've finally returned. I said, break out party kale. And at our hour of greatest need, just like in the stories.",1,04
She-Ra, What stories?,1,04
Perfuma," The stories we've been telling for thousands of years. She-Ra, the warrior who tamed the beasts of Beast Island with a single word.",1,04
Bow, That's nothing. What about the time She-Ra defeated a squad of Horde soldiers on a flying horse? Or the time she saved Thaymor from a legion of Horde soldiers? Or the time she borrowed my toothbrush and used it to defeat an army of Horde soldiers.,1,04
She-Ra," Uh, Bow, that's not true.",1,04
Bow, You're right. It was two armies!,1,04
She-Ra, Uh...,1,04
Glimmer," Hey, calm down! Give her some space. One at a time. You first.",1,04
She-Ra, Oh! Thank you for the…,1,04
Glimmer,  Windchime.,1,04
She-Ra, Wind-chime.,1,04
Perfuma, We're so excited for you to heal our land and bring all the plants back to life. Will you be doing it before the drum circle or after?,1,04
She-Ra, You want me to--You want me to heal your land?,1,04
Perfuma," Yes! Like in the ancient story, ""She-Ra Heals the Forest And Brings The Trees Back To Life.""",1,04
Glimmer,  I've seen her do way weirder stuff. This'll be a snap.,1,04
She-Ra," Wait, it's not that simple. Plus, I don't like the look of that smoke. The Horde's up to something big. Maybe we should investigate.",1,04
Perfuma, We? This is my power. I grow plants. We're not strong enough to go up against the Horde. All we want is to live peacefully in our ancestral home.,1,04
Bow, And then She-Ra saved the day once again!,1,04
Perfuma," We need you, She-Ra.",1,04
She-Ra," Yes, healing. That is a thing I know how to do. I just need to take Bow and Glimmer over to those trees for a moment. I know what I'm doing!",1,04
She-Ra,  I don't know what I'm doing! I can't heal anything!,1,04
Bow," But, the stories say you have healing powers.",1,04
She-Ra, They also say I fought the Mantisaur. I don't even know what that is!,1,04
Glimmer, Why don't you just concentrate really hard? That seems to work whenever you need to transform.,1,04
She-Ra,  Okay.,1,04
She-Ra, Did I do it?,1,04
Bow," No, you punched a tree. That's kinda the opposite of healing.",1,04
She-Ra, Let me try again. ,1,04
Glimmer, Magic blast. Also not healing.,1,04
She-Ra, I'll get it this time.,1,04
Glimmer, Magical transformation?,1,04
Bow," Wait, is that what happened to our horse?",1,04
Bow, It's okay. You'll get it soon.,1,04
She-Ra," Soon isn't good enough! These people expect me to save their land. I thought I was better as She-Ra, but I'm useless no matter what form I take.",1,04
Bow, My hat!,1,04
Perfuma, She-Ra! Come quickly! Something absolutely terrible has happened!,1,04
Perfuma," The Heart-Blossom is dying. Please, She-Ra, heal our land.",1,04
She-Ra," Oh, come on, do something.",1,04
She-Ra, No. ,1,04
Adora, Sorry. I don't know how to heal.,1,04
Plumerian Citizen 2, Who are you? And where's She-Ra?,1,04
Adora," My name is Adora. I was chosen to carry the sword of She-Ra, but... I haven't been doing this for very long, and I don't know exactly how it works yet.",1,04
Plumerian elder, She's just a girl!,1,04
Adora," I never meant to deceive you. I am She-Ra, I'm just not the same She-Ra.",1,04
Perfuma, Then you can't save us?,1,04
Adora," Wait! There might be another way. I know the Horde. I think they're using one of their machines to poison your land. If we wanna save your home, we have to stop them!",1,04
Plumerian Citizen 2, You're not She-Ra from the stories. You were supposed to save us.,1,04
Perfuma," It will be all right, I promise. We will rebuild. We have to believe that the universe will repay the Horde for their evil deeds eventually.",1,04
Glimmer," The universe won't protect you! You want She-Ra to fix everything, but won't even try to save yourselves? At least Adora's trying.",1,04
Perfuma," If She-Ra can't save us, no one can. Right now, we just need to make sure our people are safe. We leave today.",1,04
Glimmer, Are you okay?,1,04
Adora, I just wanted to help. But all I've done is disappoint an entire kingdom. I'm sorry I let you guys down after you talked me up.,1,04
Bow," We just wanted everyone to see what an awesome person you are. I thought I was being supportive, but I was being terrible!",1,04
Glimmer," Adora, She-Ra's not the reason we like you. We like you because you're our friend.",1,04
Glimmer," You have a plan, don't you?",1,04
Adora, Yeah. I think I do.,1,04
Adora," All clear. Okay, we need to find the machine. Every Horde camp is laid out the same. Guard duty's in half-hour shifts, so we walk in when the shift changes in three, two, one.",1,04
Horde soldier 1, Shift change!,1,04
Horde soldier 2, Finally! Boring shifts go by slower.,1,04
Glimmer,  You were right. The Horde is poisoning the land.,1,04
Horde soldier, Hey! What are you doing here?,1,04
Adora,"  What are you doing here? We have security clearance, password 5-echo-niner. On your way.",1,04
Horde solider, We haven't used that password in months. Hands up!,1,04
Bow, Adora? What do we do?,1,04
Adora, Run!,1,04
Plumerian Citizen 2," Hey, the Bright Moon guys left.",1,04
Perfuma," ""We've gone to the Horde camp to find the weapon killing your trees. If we don't make it, I wanted to say I'm sorry. I couldn't be the hero you wanted. -Adora."" She's still trying, even though we were so negative. Glimmer was right. This is our home, we can't let her do this alone! Everyone, She-Ra and our friends from Bright Moon are risking their lives to protect us from the Horde. We need to help them! Get the warchimes, we march!",1,04
Adora, How many soldiers can you take?,1,04
Bow, Between one and zero.  Whoo.,1,04
Glimmer,"  I'll take them all, if you give me a minute.",1,04
Perfuma," I've always said the universe will repay the Horde one day. Well, I guess that day is today!",1,04
Plumerian Child, For the She-Ra!,1,04
Glimmer, Hey. Ooh. ,1,04
Perfuma, I've never been so alive!,1,04
Adora,  For the honor of Grayskull!,1,04
She-Ra, For Etheria! ,1,04
Horde Soldier, Ew! Yuck!,1,04
Horde Soldier,  Retreat! Retreat!,1,04
Perfuma, Thank you so much! You inspired us to save ourselves. How can we ever repay you?,1,04
Glimmer," Join the Rebellion, and help me reform the Princess Alliance.",1,04
Perfuma," Um, are you sure? Didn't that go horribly the first time?",1,04
Glimmer, It went horribly for our parents. But we have a chance to do it right. We're clearly stronger together. Think what all the Princesses united could do.,1,04
Perfuma, Would I get to hit more people with flowers?,1,04
Glimmer, Absolutely.,1,04
Perfuma," You have a deal. Hey, everyone! Look at us. We're mighty rebels now.",1,04
Catra, Force Captain Catra reporting for--,1,04
Shadow Weaver," This was brought to me by retreating soldiers, retreating because their camp was attacked by Adora and She-Ra. Pathetic, you're still trying to protect her. Did you think you could keep the truth from me?",1,04
Catra," It's just a phase, she's confused. I'll bring her back in, I swear.",1,04
Shadow Weaver," Oh, yes, you will. Because until I tell you otherwise, that is your mission. And to ensure success, no matter where Adora goes, no matter how long it takes, my shadow spies will find her.",1,04
Shadow Weaver, Find her and bring her home.,1,04
Adora, What is this? ,1,04
Glimmer," Since you've never slept in a room by yourself before, Bow and I thought we'd throw you a sleepover, then you won't feel so alone.",1,04
Bow, We even got you a new bed.,1,04
Adora,  It's wonderful.,1,04
Bow," We can do this tomorrow too, since Glimmer's grounded for ignoring orders.",1,04
Glimmer, For one week.That's three weeks less than normal. And Mom said she'd consider my plan to recruit new Princesses into the rebellion!,1,04
Adora," Thanks, guys. I might not ever be the perfect hero everybody wants me to be, but that's okay.",1,04
Glimmer, Of course it's okay. Do you have any idea how annoying you'd be if you were perfect?,1,04
Bow, Aw! Best Friend Squad is having a pillow fight!,1,04
Adora," Yeah, we're not calling ourselves that.",1,04
Glimmer," I prefer ""The Glimmer Group.”",1,04
Bow, Nah. We're the Best Friend Squad.,1,04
Angella," Council, we're looking for plans to strengthen our defenses against the Horde. Who would like to go first?",1,05
Glimmer," Me, me, me. Me. Me, me.",1,05
Angella, Who besides Glimmer would like to go first?,1,05
Glimmer," Mom-- Uh, eugh, your majesty. You should let me, Bow, and Adora continue our princess recruitment mission. If we can form a new Princess Alliance, The Rebellion would actually stand a chance for once.",1,05
Angella, The princesses withdrew from the last alliance. They chose to focus on protecting their own lands.,1,05
Glimmer," So, are we supposed to just... give up? Please, let me try. All I'm proposing is a diplomatic mission.",1,05
Angella,"  So, what do you propose?",1,05
Glimmer," Anyone approaching Bright Moon by sea needs to pass through the Salineas Sea Gate. It's controlled by Mermista now that her father's retired. With her on our side, the Rebellion could control the seas. We NEED this alliance with her, Mom.",1,05
Angella," The journey is treacherous, Glimmer. I'm not sure.",1,05
Glimmer," Don't worry, Mom. With She-Ra, we can conquer anything.",1,05
Adora," And, uh, we're also gonna need a boat.",1,05
Glimmer," With She-Ra and a boat, we can conquer anything.",1,05
Bow, Aaaaand an experienced sea captain.,1,05
Glimmer," With She-Ra, a boat, and an experienced sea captain,  we can conquer anything.",1,05
Angella,  Very well.,1,05
Glimmer, Yes!,1,05
Angella," I mean it, Glimmer. No violence, and no collateral damage.",1,05
Glimmer,"  Thanks, Mom, you won't regret it.",1,05
Bow, This is so cool. Seaworthy is just like I imagined it. Everyone here looks like a real pirate!,1,05
Glimmer," Focus, Bow. We're just here to find a sea captain.",1,05
Bow, No pirates?,1,05
Glimmer, No pirates.,1,05
Bow,  Arrrr.,1,05
Adora, None of these people look qualified to sail a ship.,1,05
Glimmer, Excuse me.,1,05
Glimmer," Er, we're looking for a sea captain to take us to Salineas.",1,05
Sea Hawk, I won. Drinks all around. Put it on my friend here's tab.,1,05
Glimmer," Uh,  hiiii. We were told you're a sea captain?",1,05
Sea Hawk, I am the one and only Sea Hawk.,1,05
Sea Hawk, Has my reputation preceded me?,1,05
Bow,  Your name is Sea Hawk? That's the coolest name I've ever heard!,1,05
Glimmer," Captain Sea Hawk, we're interviewing potential captains to take us to Salineas. Would you like to apply for the position?",1,05
Sea Hawk,  Apply for the position? I am the one and only Sea Hawk. I'm offer only.,1,05
Adora,"  Okay. Just because ""Sea"" is in your name, doesn't tell us anything about your ACTUAL qualifications.",1,05
Sea Hawk," Qualifications? I once ran the 50-klick Galebreath Gauntlet in less than 20 klicks. I maneuvered the straits of Serpentine with nary a chip in the paint of my bow. My shanties are considered so desirable, that sirens fling THEMSELVES into the sea at the sound of them. And because I can tell you're wondering, my mustache is... naturally shiny.",1,05
Bow, It IS shiny. You're hired.,1,05
Bow, Ow.,1,05
Sea Hawk," Whoa, there, kids. What makes you think you can afford me?",1,05
Glimmer," I assure you, Captain Sea Hawk, money is no object.",1,05
Sea Hawk, Behold my fee.,1,05
Glimmer," Money might be an object. You know what, fine. We'll just find ANOTHER sea captain.",1,05
Sea Hawk," Good luck with that. You won't find another soul who knows the treacherous route to Salineas as well as I do. I brave it often to visit my close personal friend, Princess Mermista.",1,05
Glimmer,  You know her?,1,05
Sea Hawk, Uh do I?,1,05
Adora," Okay, well, here's the deal. We go one round, winner takes all. You win, we leave you alone. I win, you take us to Salineas. At no cost.",1,05
Sea Hawk," That's a terrible deal. But I am undefeated at arm wrestling. Let me show you how it's done, lassie.",1,05
Bow," Go Adoraaaa, put him in the dirt.",1,05
Glimmer, This is so dumb.,1,05
Sea Hawk, Ha! Is this the best you've got? I once beat a Tyrosaur with biceps the size of my head in an arm-wrestling match that lasted two weeks.,1,05
Adora, Ha!,1,05
Bow, Yeah! ,1,05
Sea Hawk,"  Well, truth be told, I let you win so as to, ahem, boost your confidence.",1,05
Mermista, Also your friend can turn into an 8 foot tall,1,05
Busgirl," Oh, I got it",1,06
Soda Pop, Don't forget this.,1,06
Baker," Oh, buttered biscuits.  I'll never get used to these things.",1,06
Soda Pop, At least I don't have to get lost in that maze of hers anymore.,1,06
Entrapta, A pig.  So cute.,1,06
Entrapta," Log.  Day 103. 104? No, definitely 103.    First Ones artifact number 58 has yielded a treasure trove of intact code.    If I can successfully translate it, it could hold the secrets of the First Ones.",1,06
Entrapta," Fascinating, my roots seem to be responding to the code.    This is remarkable.    Could this be my biggest step yet in making ancient and modern technology truly compatible?",1,06
Entrapta," Edit to log, I am now going to run.",1,06
Glimmer, Princess Entrapta will be a total catch for the Rebellion.  My mother is going to be so impressed!,1,06
Adora," Uh, I'm all for impressing Angella, but why is Entrapta so important?",1,06
Bow," She's a brilliant inventor.  She makes robots and rehabs old tech left by the First Ones.  She's a pretty big deal in the Etherian makers community. Which I am a part of, because I dabble in gadgetry myself.",1,06
Adora,  What does any of that mean?,1,06
Glimmer," It means, if we convince Entrapta to join the Rebellion, she'll invent all sorts of cool junk for us.  And then we'll finally have weapons that can stand up to the Horde's.",1,06
Bow," Like my trick arrows!  I'm running low so I built some new ones. This one is a stun arrow.  This one is an emergency flare.  And this one, this one's just pointy. And here is my newest one. Sonic arrow!",1,06
Glimmer,  When will we ever need a sonic arrow.  If we have to wake up really early?,1,06
Adora,  Or if we get separated in a crowd?,1,06
Bow," ""Separated in a crowd"".  I bet Entrapta will like my arrows.",1,06
Bow, Must have been a rock slide.  Any loud sound could cause another slide. We need to be as quiet as -,1,06
Adora, FOR THE HONOR OF GRAYSKULL!,1,06
She-Ra, Ha! I'm getting the hang of this.,1,06
Bow, That was incredibly dangerous.,1,06
She-Ra, What's the big deal? It worked.,1,06
Bow, You can't just bust through everything with magic.  She-Ra could have caused an avalanche.,1,06
She-Ra," But she didn't, OK?  I've spent my whole life without powers.  No way I'm going to stop using them now.",1,06
Bow," Whoa, she's got lightning.",1,06
Glimmer, Something's wrong.  The castle's distress beacon is lit.  They must be under attack.,1,06
She-Ra, There's been no reports of the Horde in this area.,1,06
Bow," No, be careful!",1,06
Glimmer, You okay?,1,06
She-Ra, This place feels wrong... It's nothing.,1,06
She-Ra," Hey, who's there?",1,06
Glimmer," Hello?  Princess Entrapta.  We're here to, uh, recruit you for the Rebellion.",1,06
Bow," Okay, we need to be careful.  Entrapta has traps set up all over her castle.  They're supposed to be really cool.",1,06
Random person from sewer, They're coming.  Get out of the square.,1,06
She-Ra, Who's coming?  Is it the Horde?,1,06
Glimmer, Hello?  Come back.,1,06
Glimmer, I'm thinking we should probably move away from whatever is making that sound.,1,06
She-Ra, This way.,1,06
She-Ra, What the-,1,06
Bow, Looks like one of Entrapta's designs.  Why would it attack us?,1,06
She-Ra," Alright, stand back.",1,06
Bow," Careful, it could be a-",1,06
Bow, Glimmer!  Adora!,1,06
Glimmer, Bow!  He's all alone with those things!  He needs us!,1,06
She-Ra, We have to get out of here first.,1,06
Glimmer," Come on, I'll teleport us out.",1,06
She-Ra," Uh, is this out?",1,06
Glimmer, Ugh.,1,06
Glimmer," Princess Entrapta?  I mean, so good to see you.  I hope you don't mind, but we sort of let ourselves in.",1,06
She-Ra," And then we let ourselves out of your cage, trap thing.",1,06
Entrapta," Welcome to Dryl!    Things are usually really fun around here, but right now it's all kind of teensy bit deadly.",1,06
Bow, Let me go.,1,06
Soda Pop, Please keep your voice down sir.     The robots respond to sound.,1,06
Baker, We're just trying to help you.,1,06
Bow," Oh, thanks?  What's going on?  Why are the robots attacking people?",1,06
Busgirl, We don't know.  We're just the kitchen staff.,1,06
Baker, Miniature cupcake? Princess Entrapta only eats tiny food.,1,06
Soda Pop, And delicious fizzy beverages.,1,06
Bow," Uh, thank you?",1,06
Baker," You'll be safe in here with us.  We've got enough food to last for months.  It's tiny, but still.",1,06
Busgirl," The bots will run out of power eventually, right?",1,06
Bow, We need to do something.  You can't just hide in here forever.,1,06
Busgirl, Oh yes we can.  We don't have powers like the princesses.  We can't - fight.,1,06
Soda Pop," Sir, kindly quiet your whatever that is.",1,06
Bow, It's a tracker pad.  It tracks energy signatures from magic.    It will help me find my friends.,1,06
Baker, Are those little dot thingies your friends?,1,06
Bow, Gonna go with no.,1,06
Entrapta, You're lucky I found you.  I designed the castle as a labyrinth.  I'm the only one who can navigate it.,1,06
Glimmer, Which means you can help us find our friend?,1,06
Entrapta, Absolutely,1,06
She-Ra, Is she sure about that?,1,06
Glimmer," Hi, um, I think we passed this picture already.",1,06
Entrapta," Oh, isn't it cute? You might be right.  I usually have my electronic map to get around.  But, well, like my bots it's sort of evil right now.",1,06
Glimmer," Yeah, about that-",1,06
She-Ra, Why did you invent killer robots?,1,06
Entrapta," You're abnormally tall.  Hello! I like your sword.  It's First One tech, right?  Can I touch it?",1,06
She-Ra," Uh, thank you, yes, and no, not right now.",1,06
Glimmer, About the killer robots?,1,06
Entrapta," They didn't start out that way.  Usually they're super useful.  They do almost everything for me.  Cleaning, filing, basic hygiene.  Oh, and they're sound activated.  Here, I'll show you!",1,06
Glimmer," Uh, can we maybe not do that?",1,06
Entrapta,  Isn't it adorable?,1,06
Entrapta, It's trying to talk!,1,06
Glimmer," Whatever it's saying, I don't think it's good.",1,06
She-Ra, Make it stop.,1,06
Glimmer, Make what stop?,1,06
Entrapta, Bot 329 is attempting to communicate.,1,06
Entrapta," Oh no, bad bot.",1,06
She-Ra, Princess!,1,06
Glimmer, She-Ra!  Stop!,1,06
Baker," Oh, the door won't hold much longer.",1,06
Bow, Almost done.,1,06
Soda Pop, Are you sure about this?,1,06
Baker," Uh, you guys",1,06
Bow, Now!,1,06
Baker, Here goes nothing.,1,06
Soda Pop, Shoot it already.,1,06
Bow," I can't, it's a sonic arrow, it'll draw more bots.",1,06
Busgirl," Is it over?  I did that?  Hey, I did that!",1,06
Bow," Nice work, now let's find my friends!  Come on.",1,06
Glimmer," Adora?  Wake up, please wake up!",1,06
Entrapta, The tall one seems infected too.  She turned less tall. How does it work?,1,06
Glimmer," She's not an it, she's my friend. And what do you mean she's infected too?",1,06
Entrapta, It's really fascinating. I've been experimenting with a disc that was recovered from a mine in Dryl. It was a game-changer. It held more complete First One's code than anything I've ever seen before. But it seems to have reacted with the First Ones tech that powers my bots. It infected them with some sort of a virus.,1,06
Glimmer, But why would it make She-Ra sick?,1,06
Entrapta," Well, I'd have to take her apart to be sure.    But since her sword is First One's tech, it must have spread through that.",1,06
Glimmer," First, you're not taking her apart. She is a PERSON!    Second, if we destroy this disc, will that turn off the bots and stop the virus?",1,06
Entrapta, Destroy it? But the experiment isn't complete!,1,06
Glimmer, I think we can safely say that this experiment is a failure!,1,06
Entrapta," But what if it's not- no, you're right, it's a failure.",1,06
Adora," Glimmer, there's two of you.  That's nice.",1,06
Glimmer, How are you feeling?,1,06
Adora, Just peachy.  Why are we whispering?,1,06
Glimmer, Sound activates the robots.,1,06
Adora, What ROBOTS?,1,06
Glimmer, The ones that are attacking us.,1,06
Adora," Oh, those robots.  Okay, I'm going to take a nap now.",1,06
Glimmer," No no no no, stay awake, we have to go to Entrapta's lab and destroy this disc thing and then you'll be all better again.",1,06
Adora," Better?  I'm fine.  I'm She-Ra.   Hi, Glimmer.",1,06
Glimmer," Come on, we've got to get to your lab.  She's getting worse.",1,06
Entrapta, A-ha!,1,06
Entrapta," Oh, we're here.  I mean, uh, of course we're here.  We were never lost.",1,06
Entrapta," Wow, the door is infected too, it won't let us in.  That is so smart.  And awful.  We're all going to die.",1,06
Glimmer," It's okay, I've got this one.  I'll just teleport into the lab.",1,06
Entrapta," Ooo, teleportation.  How does that work?  Tell me everything.",1,06
Glimmer," Sure, but maybe later, when we're not, like, facing a robot uprising.",1,06
Entrapta, It's a date.,1,06
Glimmer, I'll be right back.,1,06
Adora," Okay, I'm just gonna wait here.",1,06
Glimmer, That was not such a great plan.  The lab is very full of robots.,1,06
Entrapta, How did they look?,1,06
Glimmer, Pretty evil.  I couldn't get anywhere near the disc.,1,06
Bow," No, that's Glimmer teleporting.  I know where Glimmer and Adora are.  Uh oh, that's not good. We have to do something, we have to save them.",1,06
Busgirl," Oh no, sir, no thank you.",1,06
Soda Pop," It's one thing to fight them off out of necessity, but to seek out danger?  It's madness.  Pardon me.",1,06
Baker," Look, they're princesses, they have powers.  I make baked goods.",1,06
Bow," Sure, we don't have powers like the princess, but that never stopped me, and  it doesn't have to stop you.",1,06
Baker," But you're a master archer, we're just ordinary people.",1,06
Bow," I'm a master archer who's out of arrows, but that never stopped me either. You each have a skill that only you can do, even if it doesn't come from some magical jewel.  You say you're just ordinary people, I say you're warriors of the Rebellion!",1,06
Baker, To the Rebellion!,1,06
Entrapta," Incredible development, the bots seem to be working together.",1,06
Glimmer," Right now, I think that's a bad thing.  We need to find another way into the lab.",1,06
Entrapta," The air duct, we can use that.",1,06
Entrapta, I don't suppose you have any other magical powers that could be useful right now?,1,06
Glimmer, I don't have enough energy to teleport us all.  Not without leaving someone's legs behind.,1,06
Entrapta, I'll give up one of mine if you give up one of yours.,1,06
Glimmer, It's Bow!,1,06
Adora," Yay, there's a rainbow!",1,06
Bow, Nice!,1,06
Glimmer, Bow!  You're okay!  I was so worried.,1,06
Bow," Big fan of your work, Princess Entrapta.  Uh, maybe not this work, exactly, but your other work.",1,06
Entrapta, Hi.,1,06
Adora, Hi,1,06
Bow," You okay, Adora?",1,06
Adora," Oh, yeah, sure, I'm totally",1,06
Glimmer," Entrapta was experimenting with First One's tech, and it infected all of her machines with some kind of virus, and She-Ra's sword got infected to and made Adora all, oh, weird. I teleported into the lab and it's full of bots and maybe we She-Ra we'd have a chance, but without her, it's hopeless.",1,06
Bow, We don't need She-Ra.  We can do this together.,1,06
Bow," Okay, where's the disc?",1,06
Entrapta, How fascinating.  It has completed protected itself.,1,06
Bow, We have to find a way to turn it off.,1,06
Adora," Hey, guys, I've found the bots.",1,06
Glimmer, Adora!,1,06
Glimmer, Shhh,1,06
Bow, Glimmer!,1,06
Baker, We'll get your friends.  You two get that disc turned off.,1,06
Bow, Keep 'em busy.,1,06
Busgirl," We got your back, princesses.",1,06
Glimmer," You dumb bots, you're going the wrong way!  Bow, watch out!",1,06
Bow," Uh, why isn't the computer turning off.",1,06
Entrapta,  It's running on its own power now!  That's it.  We need to get outta here and burn this place to the ground.  Experiment officially failed.,1,06
Bow," Wait, I have an idea.",1,06
Bow, Now's your chance sonic arrow!  I believe in you!,1,06
Adora, Where am I?  What's happening?,1,06
Glimmer," Thanks, former tall one, and companions, for saving our lives.  I would be honored to join your Rebellion and provide you with weapons.",1,06
Bow," Thanks, guys. You saved us all back there.  The Rebellion needs regular people now more than ever.",1,06
Busgirl, We are ready.,1,06
Glimmer," So, maybe you had a point before.",1,06
Bow," What?  I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.",1,06
Adora," I think what Glimmer is trying to say is that you were right, we can't always rely on our powers.",1,06
Bow," Ooohhh, is that what you were trying to say Glimmer?  That I was right?",1,06
Glimmer, Yes.,1,06
Bow, And my sonic arrow was a great idea?,1,06
Glimmer," Yes, it was brilliant, and you were totally right, okay?",1,06
Adora," If you hadn't come, the bots would have gotten us for sure.  And, I didn't know that She-Ra could get sick like that.  What if it happens again?",1,06
Bow," It won't.  We destroyed that evil, She-Ra hating disc.",1,06
Adora," Good, I never want to feel that way again.",1,06
Glimmer," Thanks for saving us, Bow.",1,06
Bow, All in a day's work for Bow and his band of Kitchen Knights! His Baking Brigade! Pastry Patrol!  I'm still working that out.,1,06
Glimmer," Oh, look at that rock just staring at us.      Boy, that rock really needs smashing.  And since She-Ra's not sick anymore, she should probably smash it!",1,06
Adora, A-ha!  What?  it's practise.  For the honor of Grayskull!,1,06
Entrapta," Log.  Day 105.  104?  Eh.    The last experiment hit a few bumps, but it was not a total failure.  I made some important discoveries.  The disc is way more powerful than I ever imagined.    With a few adjustments, I'm sure the next experiment will be a success.",1,06
Adora, Shadow Weaver raised me in the Horde. She taught me how to read and tie my boots and how to subvert the enemy and be victorious in battle.,1,07
Glimmer," OK. Sure, mom stuff.",1,07
Adora," No, commanding officer stuff...and mom stuff.",1,07
Adora," Uh, hey, guys, I got an invitation to the All Princess Ball, Winter Wonderland. Do you know what this is?",1,08
Bow, Princess Prom! Princess Prom! Princess Prom! We are going to Princess Prom!,1,08
Glimmer, Princess Prom! Princess Prom! Princess Prom! We are going to Princess Prom!,1,08
Adora," Okay, you've gone crazy. I'll just come back later.",1,08
Bow, The ball is a meeting for all the princesses of Etheria.,1,08
Glimmer," And a giant party! Dancing, food, fancy dresses.",1,08
Adora, Dancing?,1,08
Glimmer, It only happens once a decade. I've been waiting years for this!,1,08
Adora," Uh, I'm only a princess sometimes, so are you sure I should even go?",1,08
Glimmer, Of course! Every princess is invited! That includes you!,1,08
Bow, Oh yeah. It's all in the invite.,1,08
Adora, Rules for greeting the hostess. Expected curtsy depth? Proper stair descending etiquette?,1,08
Bow, The ball has been going on for centuries. There's a lot of etiquette stuff you gotta do before you can party.,1,08
Glimmer, It's gonna be so much fun! And Princess Frosta is hosting it this year in the Kingdom of Snows! Her magic is incredibly powerful. She'd be a huge get for The Rebellion!,1,08
Glimmer, Don't worry! I'll be with you and so will Bow 'cause he's going as my plus one!,1,08
Bow, Uh actually--,1,08
Glimmer, It's the best friend squad in action! Right Bow?,1,08
Bow, About that... I'm going with Perfuma.,1,08
Glimmer, What!?,1,08
Catra," I'm sick of this. Shadow Weaver failed to get Adora and if Hordak finds out she'll take us down with her. She's obsessed. We need to think big picture. It's time for someone new to take over. Me. So, you in?",1,08
Scorpia, I'm hanging out in your room! ,1,08
Catra," Unfortunately, you're the only one I can trust around here.",1,08
Scorpia, Because we're best friends.,1,08
Catra," Stop being so you and help me think. I have the beginning of a plan, but it's not enough. I need to capture Adora so Shadow Weaver doesn't demote me. I need to impress Hordak so he'll make me the new Shadow Weaver. How do I do both?",1,08
Scorpia," Why don't you try something at the All-Princess Ball? Every princess is gonna be there, so Adora probably will be too. Ooh! This year's theme is Winter Wonderland.",1,08
Catra, How did you get this?,1,08
Scorpia, They sent it to me. I'm a princess.,1,08
Catra, You're a princess!?,1,08
Scorpia, Yeah. The Horde crash landed in my family's kingdom. We let them stay. My family gave Hordak the Black Garnet.,1,08
Catra, You're a princess?,1,08
Scorpia," I though everyone knew. I mean, it's covered in Force Captain Orientation.",1,08
Catra," I'm beginning to think I shouldn't have skipped that. Okay, so you're a princess, and you're going to a princess ball.",1,08
Scorpia," Oh no. I'm not going. No. No one liked my family, even before we joined The Horde. I never really fit with the other princesses. I made them uncomfortable and they don't like that. They don't like me.",1,08
Catra, And that's exactly why you have to go! How dare they pretend they're better just because you're different! How dare they abandon people just because they don't fit into their perfect little lives!,1,08
Scorpia, Yeah!,1,08
Catra, How dare they take best friends and turn them into giant sword ladies who run off with people clearly inferior to you!,1,08
Scorpia, You're telling my whole life with your words.,1,08
Catra," It's time to show those princesses a thing or two! You're going, I'm coming as your plus one and we'll make this a night no one will ever forget!",1,08
Scorpia, Super Pal Duo is going to prom!,1,08
Bow, I didn't think it would be a big deal.,1,08
Glimmer, It's not. It's fine. I'm just surprised. When did you two even talk about it?,1,08
Bow," Oh, she was super slick.",1,08
Perfuma, Wanna go to the ball with me?,1,08
Bow, Okay!,1,08
Glimmer, That's super slick?,1,08
Bow," I thought it'd be fun. And besides, Perfuma's cool, right?",1,08
Glimmer," She's fine. But we always go to events together. We have our whole routine. We wear matching outfits, share inside jokes and eat ice cream afterwards. It's our thing.",1,08
Bow," Well, there's nothing wrong with a new thing. I gotta get ready. We'll hang out there, okay?",1,08
Glimmer, But I liked our old thing.,1,08
Adora," Glimmer! Good. No time to waste!  I think advance prep will be key to success. I've divided the rules into base parts. Dance rules, etiquette rules, rules for greeting the hostess.  I'm familiarizing myself with targets. Ask me anything.",1,08
Glimmer, Princess Frosta.,1,08
Adora," Ruler of The Kingdom of Snows, has the biggest kingdom outside of Bright Moon, neutral in the fight against the Horde. Allies with the Star Sisters who are friends with Mermista, but no Sweet Bee who is dating Peekablue as you can tell by the string. Up means friends, down means frenemies. And I made an obstacle course! I'm feeling good! I'm prepared for any and all scenarios. I am so ready for this ball.",1,08
Glimmer, Great! What are you wearing?,1,08
Adora," I was just gonna go as She-Ra. I mean, she has better hair.",1,08
Glimmer," Well, you can't go as She-Ra. They have a strict no weapons rule. Neutral ground and all. So, you'll have to leave your sword at the door.",1,08
Adora," Ugh, how are there more parts to this invite?",1,08
Glimmer,  You know what this means?,1,08
Adora, That clothes don't matter and I should keep on studying?,1,08
Glimmer, It's makeover time!!,1,08
Adora, Be careful and don't just lean it somewhere and don't keep it with the other swords or it might get confused!,1,08
Glimmer," Adora, c'mon!",1,08
Adora, Whoa. Heh. It's big.,1,08
Glimmer," The ball is an ancient tradition. A princess' first ball is a huge rite if passage. Plus, the Kingdom of Snows is really big.",1,08
Adora," Which is why we need Frosta. If she joins us, the other princesses are sure to follow.",1,08
Adora,"  Here we go. Hold for one, two and three. That's Frosta? But she's like, 10!",1,08
Frosta, I'm eleven and three quarters.,1,08
Glimmer," Revered hostess, we come under the ancient rules of hospitality, bringing greetings from Bright Moon. And She-Ra, the legendary warrior.",1,08
Frosta, You are welcome under the ancient rules of hospitality. Leave conflict at the door and please enjoy the ball.,1,08
Adora, Thank you your--  majesty. Couldn't have mentioned that she was a little kid?,1,08
Glimmer," You did all that research. I assumed you knew. You know what? It's fine.There's plenty of time to win her over. Come one, let's rock this ball!",1,08
Adora, Oh! There's Entrapta! Heh.,1,08
Entrapta, Adora! Glimmer! Are you here for the social experiment too?,1,08
Adora, Social experiment?,1,08
Entrapta, Different groups are forced to mingle. Hierarchies form and break. It's the perfect place to observe behavior. And they have tiny food! Where's Bow? I wanna show him my new recorder.,1,08
Glimmer, He's coming later.,1,08
Entrapta, Didn't he come with you? Aren't you two friends?,1,08
Glimmer, Why would you think we're not?,1,08
Entrapta, There he is! bow!,1,08
Glimmer, They're matching. That's out best friend thing!,1,08
Entrapta, Feelings seem to be getting hurt.,1,08
Mermista," Hey, I'm here too. Don't make a big thing out of it.",1,08
Glimmer, They're making up their own inside jokes? What? Is Perfuma his new best friend now?,1,08
Mermista, Not gonna get into whatever is happening there.,1,08
Entrapta, People walking around in circles.,1,08
Mermista," Or that. Look, have you seen--",1,08
Sea hawk,"  She's a beauty can't you see? She's attending this with me! She's my princess of the sea! Mermista!  Oh hey, it's my crew.",1,08
Adora," So, Sea Hawk's your plus one?",1,08
Mermista," No. He is just my ride. Just. My. Ride,",1,08
Sea Hawk,  Of course.  I am her plus one.,1,08
Entrapta, This is the best social experiment I've ever been to!,1,08
Mermista, Whatever. Do they have a kelp bar here?,1,08
Sea Hawk," To the buffet! Adventu-- Oh hi, Bow.",1,08
Adora, Hey--,1,08
Glimmer,"  That's so funny, Adora! What a funny inside joke the two of us just came up with!",1,08
Perfuma," The She-Ra, Glimmer. It's great to see you.",1,08
Bow, Perfuma was just telling me about a winged horse that ate all the apples in Plumeria and then flew away. Sound familiar?,1,08
Glimmer," Sure. Isn't this fun? Adora and I are having such a good time together, just the two of us. Right, Adora?",1,08
Bow," Okay. Uh, we're gonna go say hi to people. Wanna come?",1,08
Glimmer," No, you guys go on. We'll find you later. I wanna hear the rest of this funny story that Adora was just telling!",1,08
Adora, Perfect. Frosta's alone. I'm gonna try and go smooth things over with her. Coming?  Never mind. I'll be right back.,1,08
Adora, Revered hostess. I've come to apologize for earlier. I was so rude.,1,08
Frosta," Yes, you were. But as you're only an honorary princess, you can't be expected to know better.",1,08
Adora, Your kingdom is truly beautiful Princess Frosta. I'm honored to be here.,1,08
Frosta," Thank you. Now, I expect you're going to ask me to join your Rebellion?",1,08
Adora, You know about that?,1,08
Frosta, Of course I do. Princesses talk you know? The snow peas and the cookies are touching. Do it right.,1,08
Adora," Princess Frosta, the Rebellion needs you. Your kingdom is powerful. Your alliance could be the key to defeating the Horde.",1,08
Frosta, The Horde hasn't threatened us here.,1,08
Adora," That only because the Kingdom of Snows is so out of the way, it doesn't matter to Hordak right now. Joining the Rebellion is your best bet.",1,08
Frosta, The kingdom of Snows has defended itself perfectly well for thousands of years. We do not need your help or your Rebellion. Please continue to enjoy the ball.,1,08
Bow, Perfuma was just telling about a winged horse that ate all the apples in Plumeria!,1,08
Glimmer, Where have you been?,1,08
Adora," I told you, winning over Frosta. Actually, scratch that, failing to win over Frosta. Are you okay? Why does it bother you so much?",1,08
Glimmer," It doesn't! Bow can hang out with whoever he wants. I just  I never had that many friends. It's always been just me and Bow. But now, what if he likes his new friends better? What if everyone does?",1,08
Adora," That's not gonna happen. Trust me, Bow isn't the type to leave his old friends behind and neither am...",1,08
Adora, ...I.,1,08
Adora," Revered hostess, you can't let them in. They're from the Horde.",1,08
Catra," Revered hostess, Princess Scorpia was invited as per the rules of this ball. Rules which I personally have the upmost respect for.",1,08
Adora, You do not!,1,08
Frosta, Princess Adora. The rules state that all princesses and their chosen guests are welcome.,1,08
Adora, They're up to something. I can feel it.,1,08
Frosta," That's enough! You look at me and see a child, but I have worked to hard to gain respect all to throw it away just because you feel they are up to something. For centuries the All-Princess Ball has been neutral ground. I will not dishonor that legacy. Scorpia is a princess. Princesses get plus ones. They stay.",1,08
Frosta, Teenagers.,1,08
Catra," Really, Adora? I'm shocked. We're not breaking any rules. Didn't you read the invite?",1,08
Adora," I know you're plotting something. From now until the second the ball ends, I'll be watching. Wherever the two of you go, I go.",1,08
Catra, Suit yourself. Have fun with following us!,1,08
Adora,"  Glimmer, you take Scorpia, I'll take Catra.",1,08
Scorpia," Mm. Mm. Wow, that is good. Oh what is-- I don't even know what's in this. What? Sir? Garcon? What's in this?",1,08
Glimmer, Bow! Wait up!,1,08
Bow, Glimmer. Hi.,1,08
Glimmer, There's something I need to tell you. I know things between us have been weird all night. I just wanted to say..,1,08
Bow, I accept your--,1,08
Glimmer, I forgive you.,1,08
Bow," You forgive me? Glimmer, I'm allowed to hang out with other people.",1,08
Glimmer," B-b-but that's how it starts. Suddenly everyone has new friends and no one needs me anymore. And then, I'm all alone.",1,08
Bow," What are you talking about? you have me, plus Adora and everyone ho joined the Rebellion.",1,08
Glimmer," That's what i'm talking about. It used to be just us. And now, everything's changing. I don't want you to leave me behind.",1,08
Bow," No one is leaving you behind. I wanted to hang out with you and Adora and Perfuma tonight. But you're the one who keeps acting weird and leaving. I know change is scary, Glimmer. But that doesn't mean you get to take it out on me. Now, if you'll excuse me, I am going to go get my cummerbund because it is freezing in here! We'll talk later, okay?",1,08
Entrapta," Princess Prom, hour two... 37 minutes...",1,08
Adora, Don't touch her!,1,08
Entrapta,  You're right. This is a much better vantage point for my observations. Hi Adora. Have you met my new assistant? She brought snacks.,1,08
Catra, She stole my food then asked me to spy on people with her. Is this what love feels like?,1,08
Adora," Entrapta, she's from the Horde. The people the Rebellion are fighting. The Rebellion you're a part of!",1,08
Entrapta," Oh. Well, we should keep a better eye on her 'cause she just walked away.",1,08
Adora, ,1,08
Bow, Is that a--  Oh no! Princess Scorpia is planting heat bombs! We have to stop her!,1,08
Bow, What are you doing? Let me go!,1,08
Frosta," It is my duty as hostess to now announce, it is time for the first dance of the Ball.",1,08
Catra," I don't know about you, but I am having a blast.",1,08
Adora," Whatever you're planning, it won't work.",1,08
Catra, You sure?,1,08
Glimmer,  I got into a fight with Bow and I don't know where Scorpia is!,1,08
Adora, What? Glimmer don't--,1,08
Perfuma," Have you seen Bow? He went to get his cummerbund, right around when that Horde princess left.",1,08
