Adora,"   . Hey, princess. You looking at me? ",1,01
Woman over PA," All squadrons, report to training area immediately for evaluation.",1,01
Adora,  Psst. Anyone seen Catra?,1,01
Lonnie, ,1,01
Adora,  Not again.,1,01
Unknown Blue Horde Member," At attention, cadets. Your simulation is about to begin. Here's your scenario. You'll be passing through the treacherous Whispering Woods to reach the heart of the rebel insurgency, Bright Moon.",1,01
Kyle, ,1,01
Unknown Blue Horde Member, Your mission is to defeat the Queen of the Princesses and liberate Bright Moon in Lord Hordak's name. Where's Catra?,1,01
Adora, She will be here. I promise.,1,01
Unknown Blue Horde Member," Mm-hmm. The Whispering Woods is full of princesses.  Vicious, violent instigators.They will take you out if given the chance. Don't give it to them. Good luck, recruits.",1,01
Adora, Watch out!,1,01
Kyle," Oh, no, no, no, no, no!",1,01
Adora," Come on, this way.",1,01
Catra, ,1,01
Kyle,"  Aw, dang it.",1,01
Adora," Seriously, Kyle?",1,01
Lonnie, Bra-vo.,1,01
Lonnie," Seriously, Kyle?",1,01
Adora, Run!,1,01
Lonnie, Adora!,1,01
Adora,  ,1,01
Adora, ,1,01
Catra," Hey, Adora. How's it hanging?",1,01
Adora," Catra. Did you really show up late and let us do all the hard parts? That is low, even for you.",1,01
Catra," Aw. You know nothing's too low for me. . Now come on, you look stupid hanging down there.",1,01
Woman over PA, Training exercise successfully completed.,1,01
Catra," .  You should've seen your face. You were like, ""Aah, no! Betrayal.""",1,01
Adora,"  Come on, Catra. We're senior cadets now. I can't believe you're still pulling such childish, immature-- Is that a mouse?!",1,01
Catra, What!? Where!?,1,01
Adora, . Are you ever going to not fall for that?,1,01
Catra, I don't know. Are you ever going to let it go? That was one time.,1,01
Adora," I know, but for some reason it's always funny.",1,01
Shadow Weaver, Adora.,1,01
Adora, Shadow Weaver.,1,01
Shadow Weaver, You have done well. You've completed your training course in record time.,1,01
Adora," Uh, well, that wasn't just me. You know, Catra did, too.",1,01
Shadow Weaver," Ah, yes. How someone as unmotivated as you completed the course in that time, I'll never know.",1,01
Catra," Always serving up those pep talks, huh, Shadow Weaver?",1,01
Shadow Weaver," Silence. Do not be flippant with me, cadet.",1,01
Catra, Sorry Shadow Weaver.,1,01
Shadow Weaver," Adora, walk with me... Adora.",1,01
Shadow Weaver, Lord Hordak has been watching you. He thinks you are a fine candidate for Force Captain.,1,01
Adora, Really? Force Captain? Lord Hordak said that about me?,1,01
Shadow Weaver," Oh yes. He sees great promise in you. In fact, he has elected you the honor of leading a squadron in the invasion of the rebel Fortress of Thaymor.",1,01
Adora, Thaymor? You mean we're finally seeing active duty?,1,01
Shadow Weaver, You are seeing active duty.,1,01
Adora," But I'll be able to bring my team along, right?",1,01
Shadow Weaver, Your team is not ready. They'll only slow you down.,1,01
Adora," Shadow Weaver, with respect, they've been training hard for this, too. And Catra, all she wants is to get out there and prove herself.",1,01
Shadow Weaver," Then she should have worked harder to prove herself to me. This is what I raised you for, Adora. Now is your chance to prove yourself. I saw talent in you the moment I found you as an orphan child and took you in. Is this not what you've wanted since you were old enough to want anything?",1,01
Adora, Yes.,1,01
Shadow Weaver," With you at the forefront, we will crush the Bright Moon Rebellion once and for all. Do not disappoint me.",1,01
Angella, Send her in.,1,01
Glimmer, Your Majesty.,1,01
Angella, I'm told you disobeyed orders and led the Rebellion into a dangerous combat situation after you were ordered to retreat.,1,01
Glimmer, I was trying to protect a village from falling into The Horde's grasp.,1,01
Angella, You were reckless and put yourself and the other rebels in danger.,1,01
Glimmer," Fighting is supposed to be dangerous! How are we going to hold our own against The Horde if we keep retreating? Pretty soon, we won't have anything left to defend.",1,01
Angella," I'm growing tired of your back-talking, Commander Glimmer.",1,01
Glimmer, Why did you even make me a commander if you won't let me fight?,1,01
Angella, That's enough! You're grounded!,1,01
Glimmer,  Mom!,1,01
Angella, You heard me!,1,01
Glimmer, You never let me do anything!,1,01
Angella, We are not having this discussion tonight. You are embarrassing me in front of my royal court.,1,01
Glimmer," Oh, I'm embarrassing you?",1,01
Angella, Go to your room!,1,01
Glimmer, I'm going!,1,01
Angella, ,1,01
Adora, ,1,01
Catra," What'd she say? Hey, what's this?",1,01
Adora, Hey! Give it back.,1,01
Catra, No way. You've been promoted?,1,01
Adora," Well, kind of. I mean, yeah, I guess. Heh. But it's not a big deal.",1,01
Catra," Are you kidding? That is awesome. We're gonna see the world and conquer it. Adora, I need to blow something up. ",1,01
Adora, Umm..,1,01
Catra, What?,1,01
Adora, Shadow Weaver says you're not coming.,1,01
Catra, What? My time was just as good as yours today. What is her problem with me?,1,01
Adora," I mean, you are kind of disrespectful.",1,01
Catra, Why should I respect her? She's just bitter that she doesn't have any real power that doesn't come from Hordak and everyone knows it. I guess it sure must be easy being a people pleaser like you.,1,01
Adora," I am not a pe-- Catra, wait. ",1,01
Adora," Look, I'm sorry. I didn't even think you wanted to be a Force Captain.",1,01
Catra," I don't. Here, take your stupid badge.",1,01
Adora," Come on, Catra. This is what I have been working for my entire life. I was hoping you could be, I don't know, happy for me.",1,01
Catra," Ugh, whatever. It's not like I even care. I just wanna get out of this dump at some point before I die of boredom. I wonder what's even outside the Fright Zone anyway.",1,01
Adora, Why don't we go find out?,1,01
Catra, I take it all back. You're officially awesome. I can't believe you actually stole a skiff.,1,01
Adora, Borrowed. Please don't make me regret this.,1,01
Catra," I've always wanted to drive one of these things. Here, gimme.",1,01
Adora," Whoa, there. Save us enough fuel to get back.",1,01
Catra, That's a problem for future Adora and Catra.,1,01
Catra and Adora, I'm driving. I want it.,1,01
Catra, Can't have it! ,1,01
Catra, Let me.,1,01
Adora, Give me. I'm doing it.,1,01
Catra, Adora. I want it.,1,01
Adora," No, I've got it.",1,01
Adora, Catra!,1,01
Catra, What is it?,1,01
Adora," I think this must be the Whispering Woods. They say there are strange, old monsters in there, an- and the trees move when you're not looking. Every Horde squadron they've sent in there has never come out again.",1,01
Catra, Let's go in.,1,01
Adora," Wait, what? ",1,01
Catra, Woo-hoo!  ,1,01
Adora," Catra, slow down! Catra, tree! Tree! ",1,01
Catra, Adora!,1,01
Adora,  ,1,01
Adora, Catra? Huh? Whoa. Cool.,1,01
Adora, ,1,01
Female voice, Balance must be restored. Etheria must seek a hero.,1,01
Female voice," Adora, Adora.",1,01
Catra," Hey, Adora? Adora!",1,01
Adora, Catra? What happened?,1,01
Catra, You fell out of the skiff after you drove it into a tree.,1,01
Adora," No, you drove it into a tree.",1,01
Catra," Ah, up for debate. Come on, let's go.",1,01
Adora, Wait. Where is it? Where'd it go?,1,01
Catra, What?,1,01
Adora," Ther- There was a sword. It was right here. I tried to touch it, but it got really bright.",1,01
Catra," Are you brain damaged? Don't be brain damaged. Oh, Shadow Weaver's gonna kill me.",1,01
Adora," I'm not brain damaged. It was here, I saw it.",1,01
Catra," Well, there's nothing here now. So, come on, let's go.",1,01
Glimmer," ""Dear Mom, I know you'll never read this, but I have to say it somewhere. I feel like you... don't respect me.   Watch it! You almost hit me!",1,01
Bow," Hey, Glimmer.",1,01
Glimmer," Shh! Bow, what are you doing here?",1,01
Bow, What did you say? Come down here.,1,01
Glimmer," I can't, I'm grounded.",1,01
Bow, What?,1,01
Glimmer, I'm grounded.,1,01
Bow, ...What?,1,01
Glimmer, I'm... grounded.,1,01
Bow, ,1,01
Glimmer,  I'm so mad at my mom.,1,01
Bow, Is this about the siege on Elberon?,1,01
Glimmer," I was just trying to defend another one our villages from falling into The Horde's Clutches. She stationed me all the way out here because it's too remote to ever get attacked, but then it did, and it was my one chance to prove that I can do this. But she acts like I can't do anything because I'm just a princess. ",1,01
Bow," That doesn't make any sense. Everyone here is a princess. I'm, like, the only one who's not a princess.",1,01
Glimmer,  Tell that to my mom.,1,01
Bow," Hey, where does this go?",1,01
Glimmer, Bottom drawer.,1,01
Bow," Anyway, your mom might have a point. Only reason you got out of there is because of your teleportation powers, and, let's face it, they don't always work that well.",1,01
Glimmer," Looking for support here, Bow!",1,01
Bow," I'm just saying, if you wanna prove yourself, it's gonna take more than running recklessly into any old battle. Luckily, I've got just the thing. Check this out. I detected a piece of First Ones tech in the Whispering Woods. A pretty powerful one, too, by the size of these readings. If you find this one and bring it back, your mom is bound to be impressed.",1,01
Glimmer, Did you forget I'm grounded?,1,01
Angella, Glimmer? Are you in there?,1,01
Glimmer, Uh...,1,01
Bow, Ah!,1,01
Angella, Glimmer?,1,01
Glimmer," Everything's fine, Mom.",1,01
Angella, Is someone else in there? I heard voices.,1,01
Glimmer, No one else is in here. Can you please just leave me alone?,1,01
Angella," I don't appreciate your tone right now, young lady.",1,01
Glimmer, What tone?,1,01
Angella, That attitude of yours is never gonna help you know.,1,01
Glimmer," Mom, you always tell me what to do-",1,01
Angella, You cannot act that way!,1,01
Glimmer, -And that's not fair!,1,01
Glimmer, I'm in.,1,01
Adora, ,1,01
Female Voice, Adora. Adora. Adora!,1,01
Adora, ,1,01
Catra," Hey, where are you going?",1,01
Adora, Back to the woods. There's something I need to figure out.,1,01
Catra, What? You're not--,1,01
Catra, What is wrong with you? You've been acting weird since we got back. Are you sure you're not brain damaged?,1,01
Adora," Look Catra, I know I saw something out there. It's ju- I just need to get another look. It feels important somehow.",1,01
Catra, Sounds good. Let's go.,1,01
Adora, No. I don't want you getting in trouble on my behalf. Just cover for me okay? I'll be back before anyone knows I'm gone.,1,01
Catra, Adora! Adora!,1,01
Bow, Come on! Come on!,1,01
Glimmer, Uh! Please tell me we're not lost!,1,01
Bow," No, this thing is just acting up. Looks like it's being overloaded by the tech's signal. We must be getting close!",1,01
Glimmer, Uhh... I think it's that way.,1,01
Bow," What makes you say that? Oh, yeah. That'll do it.",1,01
Adora," What are you doing out here, Adora? Catra's right, this is crazy. There's no sword, you just got hit on the head a little too hard. You should just go back home and forget about all of this.",1,01
Glimmer," Bow, just let me lead the way, okay?",1,01
Bow, The light came from the edge of the forest.,1,01
Glimmer," Yes, you saw the light. It's this way.",1,01
Bow, The trackpad says otherwise.,1,01
Glimmer, It's this way--,1,01
Bow and Glimmer, ,1,01
Adora, ,1,01
Glimmer, Horde soldier!,1,01
Bow, I see her!,1,01
Bow and Glimmer, ,1,01
Adora,  ,1,01
Glimmer," Bow, catch.",1,01
Adora, Give me the sword.,1,01
Adora, Get off. Stand down. I don't wanna hurt you.,1,01
Glimmer, Since when do Horde soldiers not want to hurt anyone?,1,01
Adora, What?,1,01
Female voice," Hello, Adora.",1,01
Adora, Who are you? What's going on?,1,01
Female voice," My name is Light Hope. I have been waiting a long time for you, but I could not reach you until you forged your connection with the sword.",1,01
Adora, You sent the sword?,1,01
Light Hope," The sword is meant for you. Etheria has need of you, Adora. Will you answer its call? Will you fight for the honor of Grayskull?",1,01
Adora, What are you talking about? What-- What is-- What's Grayskull? You're not making any sense! I don't understand!,1,01
Light Hope, You will.,1,01
Adora, Wait!,1,01
Adora, ,1,01
Bow, Hey! She's awake.,1,01
Adora, What happened?,1,01
Glimmer," Quiet, Horde spy, I ask the questions. How did you make it this far into the Whispering Woods?",1,01
Adora, I just walked in. And I'm not a spy.,1,01
Glimmer," Sure, sure. You just so happened to find yourself in the Whispering Woods, like you just so happened to try and steal our sword.",1,01
Adora, It's not yours. I found it first.,1,01
Glimmer," The Whispering Woods is under the Rebellion's protection. You were lucky to make it as far as you did. Come on, Bow. Let's get this spy back to Bright Moon where she can be interrogated properly. This is perfect. Not only do we First Ones tech for the rebellion, we've also captured a Horde spy. My mom's gonna be so impressed. Now come on, on your feet.",1,01
Bow," You positive we're going the right way, Glimmer?",1,01
Glimmer," I know what I'm doing, Bow. Can you please just trust me for once?",1,01
Bow," You know I always trust you, but I'm starting to get a little freaked out. I mean, I pretty much grew up in these woods and I've never even seen this part of them. I've heard stories about weird stuff out here.",1,01
Glimmer," It's fine, okay? Just let me figure this out.",1,01
Bow," Okay! Touchy. Sorry about her. Usually she's really nice. Not much for talking, huh?",1,01
Adora, I prefer not to swap pleasantries with my captors.,1,01
Bow, Fair. Suit yourself.,1,01
Adora," You know she's a princess, right? How can you follow her? Princesses are a dangerous threat to everyone on Etheria.",1,01
Bow, Is that what Hordak told you?,1,01
Adora, Well I thought it was just common knowledge. They're violet instigators who don't even know how to control their powers.,1,01
Glimmer, ,1,01
Bow," You've never actually met a princess, have you?",1,01
Adora,"  Well, maybe not in person, but...",1,01
Glimmer, ,1,01
Adora, What happened to this place.,1,01
Glimmer, Don't play dumb with me. I bet you were part of the raiding party that did this.,1,01
Adora, What are you talking about? The Horde didn't do this.,1,01
Glimmer," Oh yeah? You're a heartless destroyer, just like all the rest of your people.",1,01
Adora, I'm not a destroyer. Hordak says we're doing what's best for Etheria. We're trying to make things better. More orderly.,1,01
Glimmer," This is what's best for Etheria? Ever since The Horde got here, they've been poisoning our land, burning our cities, destroying everything in their path. And you're a part of it! How's that for orderly?",1,01
Adora, This doesn't make any sense. The Horde would never do something like this.,1,01
Bow," Did you really not know any of this? I mean, your army is called the Evil Horde.",1,01
Adora, Who calls us that?,1,01
Bow, ...Everybody!,1,01
Adora, The Horde rescued me when I was a baby and gave me a home. They're my family. You-- you don't know them like I do.,1,01
Bow, Maybe you don't know them like you think you do.,1,01
Glimmer,  There's something out there. Something big.,1,01
Bow, How big?,1,01
Bow," So, pretty big then.",1,01
Bow, Watch out!,1,01
Glimmer, ,1,01
Glimmer, ,1,01
Adora," Hey, bug brain! Come on, Magic Sword. Oh, where's a blinding flash of light when you need one? ",1,01
Light Hope, Adora. Adora. Adora.,1,01
Light Hope, Will you fight for the honor of Grayskull?,1,01
, .. honor of Grayskull?,1,01
Adora, For the honor of Grayskull!,1,01
Bow, Glimmer?,1,02
Glimmer," Yeah, I see her, Bow.",1,02
Bow, Okay. I wanted to make sure it wasn't just me.,1,02
Adora,   Huh?,1,02
Glimmer, Stay where you are!,1,02
Adora, What did you do to me?,1,02
Glimmer, What do you mean what did 'I' do to you?,1,02
Adora, I didn't know being a princess was contagious!,1,02
Bow," Okay, okay, everyone, calm down! Wanna tell us how you did that?",1,02
Adora," I didn't do anything. All I did was pick up the sword, and then, woosh, I'm in a tiara!",1,02
Glimmer, I don't care how she did it. We just have to make sure she never does it again!,1,02
Bow, Do it again! Do it again!,1,02
Glimmer,  Bow!,1,02
Bow, Do what you did before.,1,02
Adora, I don't know what I did before!,1,02
Glimmer, No time. We have to go.,1,02
Adora, What is this place?,1,02
Bow," No idea, but in there's gotta be better than out here. ",1,02
Glimmer," Everyone, grab on, I can get us in there!",1,02
Bow," Glimmer, no! You've never teleported three people before.",1,02
Glimmer, Do you have a better idea?,1,02
Adora, What's written on this door? It looks like some kind of password.,1,02
Bow, You can read that?,1,02
Adora, You can't?,1,02
Bow, What's it say?,1,02
Adora," Uh, ""Eternia.""",1,02
Glimmer," Oh, come on!",1,02
Bow," So, Horde soldier, have you always been able to read First Ones' writing?",1,02
Glimmer, Wanna tell us what exactly is going on here?,1,02
Adora, I told you I don't know I just read the word on the door.,1,02
Glimmer," Right...  You read a word in a language that no one's spoken for a thousand years, and the door just opened into a mysterious ancient ruin. Sure.",1,02
Adora, You think I did this on purpose? You think I wanted to be a princess? Princesses are monsters.,1,02
Glimmer, Monsters? You're the monster!,1,02
Bow," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Glimmer, she did save us.",1,02
Glimmer," I don't care! We can't just trust her, Bow. Or have you forgotten everything the Horde's done to us? The people we're lost.  We need to find another way out of here and get her back to Bright Moon as soon as possible. My mother will know what to do with her.",1,02
Bow," Hey, so, thanks for saving us from that bug thing back there when you could've escaped instead.",1,02
Adora," Okay, well I didn't save you. I just wanted to get the sword, okay?",1,02
Bow, Are you sure it's not because you secretly like us?,1,02
Adora,  Wh--? I don't like you. You're my captors.,1,02
Bow, Sure.,1,02
Bow," Thanks for saving us anyway. I'm Bow, by the way.",1,02
Adora, Adora.,1,02
Bow," ""Adora."" Ah. Weird name for a Horde soldier.",1,02
Adora, Is it?,1,02
Glimmer,  For the honor of Grayskull.,1,02
Bow, What are we doing?,1,02
Glimmer," Nothing! I mean, uhh.. Look at these carvings. I think this might be a First Ones' ruin.",1,02
Adora, What's a First One?,1,02
Glimmer, You've never heard of the First Ones?,1,02
Bow," The First Ones are the original settlers of Etheria. They disappeared a thousand year ago, but they left behind a lot of old ruins and technology. Like this place.",1,02
Adora," So, what happened to them?",1,02
Bow, No one knows. They just disappeared. The Horde didn't tell you about them?,1,02
Adora, Seems like there's a lot the Horde didn't tell me.,1,02
Glimmer, Ugh. How do we get out of here?,1,02
Bow,"  It'll take forever to find a way out at this rate.  Hey! Wanna turn on some lights, Adora?",1,02
Adora, I don't know how to do that.,1,02
Bow," Maybe there's a magic word. Ooh, what's the First Ones' word for ""lights""?",1,02
Adora, I don't know. I'm not magic.,1,02
Glimmer," Obviously. Everyone, stand back.",1,02
Bow," Uh, Glimmer? Maybe you should take it easy. We're a long way from Bright Moon. It'll be awhile until you can recharge.",1,02
Glimmer, Bow!,1,02
Adora, You have to recharge your powers?,1,02
Glimmer," Can we not talk about this in front of the Horde soldier? Now, stand back.  ",1,02
Adora, Whoa. ,1,02
Glimmer, ,1,02
Bow, Wow. Are you okay?,1,02
Glimmer," I'm fine, Bow.",1,02
Bow, Oh hey! That's you!,1,02
Adora, What? That doesn't look anything like me.,1,02
Bow," No, I mean, the other you. The scary one in the cape.",1,02
Adora, That was me?,1,02
Bow," You can read that inscription, right? What's it say?",1,02
Adora," It says... ""She-Ra.""",1,02
Light Hope," Greetings, administrator.",1,02
Adora, What is this thing?,1,02
Light Hope, What is your query?,1,02
Bow, I think it's some kind of ancient hologram.,1,02
Light Hope, What is your query?,1,02
Bow, Uh... Hi. What is this place? How do we get out of here?,1,02
Light Hope, What is your query?,1,02
Bow, Welp. She's broken.,1,02
Glimmer, She's old. I'm surprised any of this stuff still works at all.,1,02
Light Hope, Administrator not detected. Lockdown initiated.,1,02
Glimmer, I didn't do it!,1,02
Bow," No. No. No lockdown! No lockdown! Adora, you gotta get it to stop!",1,02
Adora, What makes you think I can?,1,02
Light Hope, Query not recognized.,1,02
Bow, There's gotta be a password or something!,1,02
Adora," Uh, stop it! Uh, Eternia! Eternia! Give me the sword!",1,02
Glimmer, What? No!,1,02
Adora," We need the scary lady in the cape. I don't know how, but she's the key to this place, so maybe she can get us out.",1,02
Glimmer, You're a Horde soldier. I'm not giving you the sword.,1,02
Adora," Eternia! Uh, cape! Uh... She-Ra!",1,02
Glimmer, Hold on!,1,02
Bow," Glimmer, no!",1,02
Bow, Glimmer!,1,02
Bow, Glimmer? Glimmer!,1,02
Glimmer,  Did it work?,1,02
Bow,"  Yeah, it worked. Barely. Are you alright?",1,02
Glimmer, I'm fine.  I think I used too much power getting us out of there.,1,02
Bow," I don't know who could've predicted that... Oh, right. Me.",1,02
Glimmer, Bow...,1,02
Bow, Like an hour ago.,1,02
Glimmer, Bow!,1,02
Bow," Sorry. I'm just glad you're okay. No more teleporting for awhile, okay. You could really hurt yourself.",1,02
Glimmer," I'm fine, okay? Let's just get back to Bright Moon so I can recharge already. Why are you still here?",1,02
Adora, What?,1,02
Glimmer, Bow and I are hardly a crack security team. You could've escaped at any time. Why didn't you?,1,02
Adora," I just-- I wanna figure out what's happening to me, and if I go back to the Fright Zone, then I'll never know. I never knew where I came from or who my family was. Shadow Weaver said it didn't matter who I was before, that-- that I was nothing before Hordak took me in. There's always been a part of me that I don't know anything about an-- and all of this, it feels familiar somehow. I don't know how else to explain it.",1,02
Bow," Glimmer's mom knows more about First Ones' tech than anyone. She'll know what's going on with you and the sword for sure. So, if you want your questions answered, stick with us?",1,02
Glimmer, Let's go. There should be a village a few miles from here. They'll be able to give us a ride back to Bight Moon. We've wasted too much time already.,1,02
Shadow Weaver," For the last time, where is Adora?",1,02
Catra," For the last time, I don't know. You think I keep her on a leash?",1,02
Shadow Weaver, I know you're lying. You two are close. She would never depart without telling you.,1,02
Catra," Then I guess she let us both down, huh?",1,02
Shadow Weaver, Have it your way. I already know where she is. We've been tracking her.,1,02
Catra," Uh, then why did you ask me?",1,02
Shadow Weaver, Because you are going to bring her back.,1,02
Catra, I don't think so. ,1,02
Shadow Weaver, Your insolence will not protect her. You will do as I ask.,1,02
Catra," Oh, yeah? Or what?",1,02
Shadow Weaver, Or you will suffer the consequences in her place.,1,02
Glimmer," Okay, the jacket comes off.",1,02
Adora, Why?,1,02
Glimmer," If the villagers see a Horde soldier, they'll freak out. We gotta fix all this.",1,02
Adora, I feel ridiculous.,1,02
Bow, That’s ‘cause you need something to tie it all together.,1,02
Adora, I don't like it.,1,02
Glimmer," Point is, you don't look like a Horde soldier. Just keep a low profile. We'll be in and out.",1,02
Adora, What is this?,1,02
Bow, It's a festival. Like a big party. You don't have parties in the Fright Zone?,1,02
Adora," Oh, right, parties. I mean, yeah, pfft, of course. I, uh-- I don't know what that is.",1,02
Bow, Ah!,1,02
Glimmer," Did you even hear me? I said, in and out!",1,02
Bow," She has never been to a party before, Glimmer! This is serious.",1,02
Bow," So, seriously? No parties ever?  What do you guys do on your birthday?",1,02
Adora, Huh?,1,02
Bow, No birthdays?! How is your life this sad?,1,02
Adora,  What is that?,1,02
Bow, That would be a horse.,1,02
Adora, It's majestic.,1,02
Bow, You wanna go meet it?,1,02
Adora, What? No! ,1,02
Bow," Come on, it's okay. See, he likes you.",1,02
Adora,  This is the best day of my life.,1,02
Glimmer, Bow,1,02
Bow," Come on, I know you like her, too.",1,02
Adora, What's going on?,1,02
Glimmer, It's the Horde!,1,02
Bow, Why are they here? The people of Thaymor aren't a threat.,1,02
Adora, Did you say Thaymor? This can't be Thaymor.,1,02
Glimmer, Did you know something about this?,1,02
Adora," No. I mean, yes. But there's a mistake. Thaymor's supposed to be a heavily fortified rebel fortress, not a civilian town!",1,02
Glimmer, Do you really think that matters to them?,1,02
Adora, This is a big mistake. I just need to talk to them. Get as many people out as you can. I'm sorry!,1,02
Glimmer, Adora!,1,02
Adora, Stop!,1,02
Catra, Adora!,1,02
Adora, Catra?,1,02
Catra, They let me drive a tank. Believe it?,1,02
Adora, I don't understand. Why are you here?,1,02
Catra," Uh, duh, we came to find you. ""Cover for me, Catra. No one will even  know I'm gone."" Did you just get immediately captured right after you snuck out--? What are you wearing?",1,02
Glimmer, Uh Bow! ,1,02
Bow, Hey!,1,02
Adora, There's no time. We have to stop this.,1,02
Catra, What? Why?,1,02
Adora, Look around. This is a civilian town. These aren't insurgents. They're innocent people.,1,02
Catra," Yeah, innocent people who kidnapped a Horde officer. Let's get back to the Fright Zone. Shadow Weaver is freaking out.  It'd be funny if she weren't such a terrible person.",1,02
Adora," Catra, no. I can't go back. Not until the Horde leaves this town alone. Help me.",1,02
Catra, What are you saying?,1,02
Adora," I’m saying, this is wrong. They've been lying to us, manipulating us. Hordak, Shadow Weaver, all of them.",1,02
Catra, Duh! Did ya just figure that out? Manipulation is Shadow Weaver's whole thing. She's been messing with our heads since we were kids.,1,02
Adora, How could you possibly be okay with that?,1,02
Catra," Because, it doesn't matter what they do. The two of us look out for each other. And soon we'll be calling the shots. Now, can we go home?",1,02
Adora, I'm not going home. Not after everything I've seen. Come with me. You don't have to go back there. We can fix this.,1,02
Catra," Are you kidding? You've known these people for, what, a couple hours? And you're just gonna throw everything away for them? Ugh. What happened to you?",1,02
Adora," I don't know. But I have to do something. I'm sorry, Catra!",1,02
Bow, Ah! I think that's all of them. What will we do?,1,02
Glimmer, There's nothing we can do. You're almost out of arrows and I'm almost out of magic.,1,02
Bow," You can't say that. You're Glimmer. You throw yourself into every fight, no matter how hopeless.",1,02
Glimmer," Ugh. Every decision I've made in the past day has almost gotten us killed. My mom's right, I'm not ready for this.",1,02
Bow," No. You are not giving up now. I’m sorry your mom doesn't see how strong you are. You can do this, Glimmer, and you’re not alone.",1,02
Glimmer, You're right. We need Adora.,1,02
Bow, Didn't she just sell us out to the Horde?,1,02
Glimmer, I don't think she did. We need to find her. She can help us. Just trust me. Okay?,1,02
Catra," Oh, man. That was a lot stronger than I thought. Are you okay?",1,02
Adora, Catra!,1,02
Catra, Sorry! It was a reflex.,1,02
Adora, Why are you doing this?,1,02
Catra," Because you left me. And if I don't bring you back, Shadow Weaver’s gonna have my head. So, enough with your weird little identity crisis and let's go home. Or do I need to zap you again? ",1,02
Adora, Glimmer?,1,02
Glimmer, Watch out!,1,02
Catra, Adora!,1,02
Adora, What are you doing? Why did you save me?,1,02
Glimmer, We need you. We need She-Ra. I should've given this back to you in the ruin. You could've saved us and I knew that. But I was stupid. And a jerk. And I'm sorry!,1,02
Adora, You're not a jerk. I'm the Horde soldier. How do you know you can trust me now?,1,02
Glimmer, I don't. But I hope I can. I feel like maybe you're here to help us.,1,02
Adora, For the honor of Grayskull!,1,02
Bow," It's been an honor serving beside you, Horsey.",1,02
Glimmer, Bow! Are you okay?,1,02
Bow, Is that Adora?,1,02
Glimmer, It's She-Ra.,1,02
Horde soldier, Retreat!,1,02
Adora, Catra...,1,02
Glimmer, You did it!,1,02
Adora, I did?,1,02
Glimmer, You saved us. You saved everyone!,1,02
Adora,  I did it. I turned against the Horde. I turned against the Horde!  I can't go back now. Where am I supposed to go?,1,02
Glimmer," Hey, hey. It's okay. You're with us now. C’mon, let's go home.",1,02
Bow," Best-friends squad! Wait, whose horse was this?",1,02
Bow," Hey, we made it.",1,03
Adora, Whoa.,1,03
Glimmer, Welcome to Bright Moon.,1,03
Adora, It’s so beautiful.,1,03
Glimmer," Okay, I just need to go in there, recharge, and deal with my mom.  This’ll be fun.",1,03
Glimmer," Uh, Bow? Maybe we should take Adora in the back way?",1,03
Bow," Oh, yeah. Good call.",1,03
Adora, What’s the back way?,1,03
Adora, This is the back way?,1,03
Bow," It might seem weird, but we totally come in this way all the time.",1,03
Bow," Oh! Hey, here. Why don’t you put this robe on? No reason.",1,03
Adora, You’re trying to hide me.,1,03
Bow,  What? No!,1,03
Angella, Glimmer! Where have you been?,1,03
Glimmer," Hey, mom.",1,03
Angella, All of Bright Moon has been worried sick. What were you thinking?,1,03
Glimmer, Mom!,1,03
Angella,  How could you be so selfish and disobedient?,1,03
Glimmer, ,1,03
Angella,  Glimmer.,1,03
Glimmer, ,1,03
Angella, Are you all right?,1,03
Glimmer," I’m fine, mom.",1,03
Angella, Don’t think you’re not still in trouble. You didn’t even take the time to charge up before you left?,1,03
Glimmer, I didn’t think I’d be gone that long.,1,03
Angella," Where did you go, anyway?",1,03
Glimmer," Okay. Bow and I found a piece of super powerful First Ones tech in the woods. We knew it would really help the Rebellion, so we went to get it and bring it back. But we got a little sidetracked. It was fine, though, and I totally had it under control. And while we were out there, we found something even better!",1,03
Angella, What did you find?,1,03
Glimmer, I can’t tell you yet. But you’re gonna love it. I promise!,1,03
Angella, Glimmer—,1,03
Glimmer, Ah! Just wait here. I’ll be right back.,1,03
Angella," We are not done talking about this, Glimmer. Glimmer!",1,03
Adora," Okay, I get it. I’m guessing the people of Bright Moon are gonna be a little less welcoming of a Horde soldier than you led me to believe.",1,03
Bow, Maybe a little.,1,03
Adora, How little?,1,03
Bow, Think pitchforks and torches.,1,03
Bow, It’s just that the people of Bright Moon have been really hurt by the Horde. Everyone here has lost someone in the war. You can’t blame them for being a little suspicious.,1,03
Adora, Sorry.,1,03
Bow," Hey, it’s not your fault. Once they get to know you, the people of Bright Moon are going to trust you just like Glimmer and I already—",1,03
Glimmer,"  I’m here! Okay, my mom’s on her way, but no one panic.",1,03
Adora, What?,1,03
Glimmer,  I said no one panic!,1,03
Glimmer," Don’t worry, she’ll love you. All you have to do is use the sword to transform into She-Ra before she gets here.",1,03
Bow," Wait, we’re jumping straight to She-Ra with your mom? Are you sure?",1,03
Glimmer," Yeah, I don’t think my mom is going to buy, “Hey mom, we found a Horde soldier. Can we keep her?”",1,03
Glimmer, My mom is gonna love She-Ra. We can ease her into the Horde stuff later.,1,03
Adora," Uh, Glimmer, look. I don’t know if I can just ‘turn on’ She-Ra. I’ve only done it when someone was in danger before, and it felt a little out-of-control last time. I’m still figuring out how all of this stuff works.",1,03
Glimmer," How hard can it be? Sword, magic words, poof! She-Ra!",1,03
Glimmer," Hey. You’re gonna do great, okay? Bow and I will go buy you some time. Just hang out here with the sword and think She-Ra thoughts. I believe in you!",1,03
Bow, ,1,03
Adora,"  Right. Okay, sword, it’s just you and me now. So, uh…let’s do this. ",1,03
Adora, For the honor of Gray—,1,03
Adora, Horsey! ,1,03
Adora, Oh! This is much better. There’s actually room to move around here.,1,03
Adora, Ready to see something cool?,1,03
Adora,  For the honor of Grayskull!,1,03
Adora," Okay, let’s try that again. For the honor of Grayskull!",1,03
Adora,  For the honor of Grayskull!,1,03
Adora,  For the honor of Grayskull!,1,03
Adora,  For the honor of Grayskull.,1,03
Adora,  For…the…honor…of…Grayskull.,1,03
Adora,  For the honor of Grayskull.,1,03
Adora,"  Honor of Grayskull, blah blah blah.",1,03
Adora," Oh, come on! Glimmer’s counting on me. Don’t leave me hanging here.",1,03
Adora, For the honor of Grayskull!,1,03
Adora," Horsey, no!",1,03
Adora," Horsey, it’s okay!",1,03
Crowd, ,1,03
Adora," No! No, wait! Horsey! Stop!",1,03
Adora,  Horsey!,1,03
Adora, Come back!,1,03
Woman,  Horde soldier…,1,03
Bright Moon Soldier, Horde Soldier!,1,03
Adora," Wait, you don’t understand. Stop! I’m not with the Horde. Just listen to me!",1,03
Woman 1,  Go! Get her!,1,03
Woman 2, Don’t let her get away!,1,03
Woman 1, Move!,1,03
Angella," For the last time, what is this grand surprise that I’m supposed to be so impressed with?",1,03
Glimmer," You’ll see it in just a minute, Mom. I promise.",1,03
Glimmer," Bow, can you go check and make sure that the surprise is ready for us?",1,03
Bow," You got in, Princess.",1,03
Angella,  I like that boy.,1,03
Gimmer," I know you do, Mom. And you’re gonna like this surprise even more. ",1,03
Bow,  So…problem.,1,03
Glimmer, What?,1,03
Woman, Your majesty. A horde spy has been discovered on the Bright Moon grounds. She attacked our troops with a sword and then fled with the help of a winged beast.,1,03
Angella, What did you do?!,1,03
Lonnie, I’m telling you. This new princess is no joke. She wiped the floor with our whole recon squad. Twelve feet tall at least! Took out every one of our machines with nothing but a sword.,1,03
Woman, Did you actually see her?,1,03
Lonnie," No. And it’s a good thing, too. We were lucky to get out of there alive.",1,03
Lonnie," Sure. You were the only one who saw her up close, and you didn’t even land a hit on her.",1,03
Lonnie, What? Did you freeze up?,1,03
Catra,  You think I’m scared of some princess? I could take her out whenever I want. I know her secret.,1,03
Lonnie,  Oh yeah?,1,03
Catra, ,1,03
Lonnie, And what’s that?,1,03
Catra,  Hmm. Like I’d tell you.,1,03
Lonnie," Easy, Catra. Adora’s not here to protect you anymore.",1,03
Adora,"  Stupid. You just had to go out there, even after Bow warned you about the pitchforks and torches.",1,03
Adora,  What do you want from me now? Haven’t I done enough for you?,1,03
Adora,  For the honor of Grayskull?,1,03
Adora,  What’s wrong with you?,1,03
Adora, Horsey? Is that you?,1,03
Razz, ,1,03
Razz," Hm? Did you hear something? Yes, I did, too. Who’s there?!",1,03
Adora,"  I, uh, didn’t mean to intrude. Um, but have you seen a flying horse around here?",1,03
Razz," Oh, Mara, dearie! Is that you? About time you got here. Come on now, there’s no time to waste. Let’s get going.",1,03
Adora,"  Uh, you were waiting for me?",1,03
Razz, [laughs[ We made plans to go berry-picking today.,1,03
Adora," Look, I’m sorry, but I think you’ve mistaken me for someone else. I don’t know who you are.",1,03
Razz," No, you don’t know Madame Razz, do you? You’re not quite the same. This is the wrong time for my Mara, isn’t it? Now you’ve got the sword, instead.",1,03
Adora," Wait, what?",1,03
Razz," Ah! Well, never mind. You’re here now, and there’s still berries to be picked.",1,03
Adora," Hey, uh, you’ve said something about the sword. Have you seen it before?",1,03
Razz,"  Don’t ask such silly questions, Mara. You know you bring that sword around here all the time.",1,03
Adora, I’m not—Okay. How long have you been living out here in the woods alone?,1,03
Razz," Alone? Me? Oh, no! I’m not alone. I’ve got Broom here, and my friend Loo-Kee, too! But he’s always hiding. ",1,03
Adora,"  Oh, good, she’s got imaginary friends.",1,03
Adora, Whoa.,1,03
Razz, Ah! Here we are.,1,03
Adora," I think I’ve seen a place like this before. This is a First Ones ruin, isn’t it?",1,03
Razz,  And the best place to pick fresh berries!,1,03
Adora," Hey, be careful up there! That thing’s not safe.",1,03
Razz,"  Oh, dearie me! That was quite a tumble, eh?",1,03
Adora, Stars?,1,03
Razz," Oh, we used to come here to look at the stars. Do you remember, Mara? They’re all gone now. What happened to the stars?",1,03
Adora, I’ve seen them before. I know all of this somehow.,1,03
Adora, What is this? What’s happening to me?,1,03
Razz, ,1,03
Adora," Look, I know you brought me here for a reason. If you know something about the sword, about me, you need to tell me!",1,03
Razz," I brought you here to pick berries, and your basket’s still empty. So, come on, silly.",1,03
Adora, Whoa! ,1,03
Catra, ,1,03
Shadow Weaver,  Catra!,1,03
Catra,  What do you want?,1,03
Shadow Weaver," Impertinent as always, I see. With such a grand failure under your belt, it would benefit you to show more respect, cadet.",1,03
Catra, I did exactly what you told me to do. You are the one who didn’t warn us there would be princesses there.,1,03
Shadow Weaver, Lies!,1,03
Shadow Weaver," I am out of patience to address your incompetence and your insubordination, cadet. You will answer to a higher power, Lord Hordak himself.",1,03
Adora,  Wait! Will you slow down?,1,03
Razz," Eh? What’s that, dearie? I don’t have my glasses; you’ll have to speak up.",1,03
Adora," Oh, I know you can hear me. I just—I need you to tell me what to do!",1,03
Razz,  How would Madame Razz know what you should do?,1,03
Adora," Look, I left my whole life behind, looking for answers about where I came from and who I’m supposed to be. The Rebellion hates me, and I can’t go back to the Horde. And I wanna do the right thing, but I don’t know what that is.",1,03
Adora, ,1,03
Razz," Ah, it’s the same old story, dearie. Wicked people destroy what they cannot control.",1,03
Adora, They can’t just do this!,1,03
Razz," Once, the princesses would have protected us. But these days, they—they stay in their castles, protecting only their own lands. Meanwhile, the Horde creeps ever closer.",1,03
Razz," You’re very like my Mara, you know? Brave, loyal, but afraid.",1,03
Adora, I’m not afraid.,1,03
Razz, Dearie… You ran into the woods and asked the first old lady you could find what you should do!,1,03
Razz," No one is going to make this easy for you, dearie. Stop waiting for someone to tell you what the right thing to do is.",1,03
Razz, You’re a smart girl. What do you think?,1,03
Adora, I think…this is wrong.,1,03
Adora, Horsey.,1,03
Razz, Huh?,1,03
Adroa,  For the honor of Grayskull.,1,03
Horde Soldier, Keep those lines taut.,1,03
Adora, ,1,03
Swift Wind, ,1,03
She-Ra, Turn off your machines and leave this place now!,1,03
Horde Soldier, It’s the princess. Get her!,1,03
Horde Soldier, Huh? Uh…,1,03
Razz, That’s my girl. ,1,03
Razz,"  Take that, you great lump! Razzle Dazzle!",1,03
She-Ra," Razz, no! You can’t be here!",1,03
Swift Wind, ,1,03
Razz, Woo-hoo!,1,03
Razz," Mara, dear!",1,03
Horde Soldier, Yeah!,1,03
Razz, Razzle Dazzle! ,1,03
Swift Wind, ,1,03
Razz," Hello, dearie.",1,03
Adora, Ow.,1,03
Razz, Swift Wind and I have been talking while you were asleep. He thanks you for coming to his rescue.,1,03
Adora, Swift Wind?,1,03
Razz," That’s what he prefers to be called. Also, he wanted me to make sure that you know that “Horsey” was a stupid name.",1,03
Razz, How do you feel?,1,03
Adora, I’m…I’m okay. I think I know what I need to do.,1,03
Adora," If the princesses won’t defend Etheria, then I will.",1,03
Adora, I need to get back to Bright Moon.,1,03
Razz," Ah, that’s the spirit, dearie!",1,03
Adora, Will I see you again?,1,03
Razz," If you need me, you will always know where to find me.",1,03
Razz,  Who was that girl?,1,03
Adora,"  Um…any chance I can get a ride back to Bright Moon, Swift Wind? Please?",1,03
Swift Wind, ,1,03
Adora, ,1,03
Swift Wind, ,1,03
Adora, Woo-hoo! ,1,03
Angella, How could you possibly think this was acceptable?!,1,03
Glimmer," Mom, you don’t understand! You’re not listening!",1,03
Angella, You’ve shown remarkably poor judgment! Allowing a Horde soldier into Bright Moon without telling me?,1,03
Bow," Your majesty, it’s not all her fault.",1,03
Angella," Bow, I think it’s time you went home. Glimmer and I have a lot to discuss.",1,03
Glimmer, Mom!,1,03
Angella, It can’t be.,1,03
Glimmer," I was trying to tell you. Mom, meet—",1,03
Angella, She-Ra.,1,03
She-Ra," Your Majesty, I’ve come to pledge myself to the Rebellion. But first, there’s something you should know.",1,03
Woman, She’s a Horde Soldier.,1,03
Glimmer," Mom, this is Adora.",1,03
Adora,"  I know you have no reason to trust me, Your Majesty. But I’ve seen for myself the atrocities the Horde has committed against the people of Etheria, and I’m ready to fight to stop them. If you give me the chance, I know I can help the Rebellion turn the tide of the war.",1,03
Angella,  I know the legend of the warrior the First Ones called She-Ra. They said she would return to us in the hour of our greatest need to bring balance to Etheria. I never thought she was anything more than a myth.,1,03
Angella," And yet you’re here now. And in the uniform of a Horde soldier, no less.",1,03
Angella, You would pledge to stand with us against those you once served?,1,03
Adora,  Yes.,1,03
Angella," Glimmer, you would vouch for her and take responsibility for her?",1,03
Glimmer, Yes.,1,03
Angella," Then rise. The Rebellion accepts your allegiance, She-Ra, Princess of Power.",1,03
Crowd,  She-Ra! She-Ra! She-Ra!,1,03
Glimmer,  Welcome to Bright Moon!,1,03
Bow,  But for real this time.,1,03
Shadow Weaver, Lord Hordak.  Kneel!,1,03
Hordak, Then you mean to tell me that you’re still down a Force Captain?,1,03
Shadow Weaver," Yes, my lord. But rest assured, nothing will stop us from finding Adora and bringing her back.",1,03
Hordak, No. You will elect another Force Captain and resume normal operations.,1,03
Shadow Weaver," But, my lord, Adora is the only viable candidate.",1,03
Hordak," You have Catra. Was she not your ward, as well?",1,03
Shadow Weaver, Catra has been nothing but a disappointment to me.,1,03
Hordak," If you have failed to condition her properly, you have no one but yourself to blame.",1,03
Shadow Weaver," But, my lord—",1,03
Hordak," Enough. I have made my decision. Rise, Force Captain Catra.",1,03
Hordak, Hmm.,1,03
Glimmer, This is awesome! I can't believe Mom agreed to let you stay in Bright Moon!,1,04
Adora," Yeah, awesome.",1,04
Glimmer," Okay. You've seen the dining room, throne room, portrait hall. So, the last stop on our grand tour is... your new room! Ta-da!",1,04
Glimmer," It's pretty standard. You've got your vanity, the bathroom, crystals, bell pull, tea nook, more crystals, bed, desk, and of course, the waterfall.",1,04
Adora, Is the waterfall for showering?,1,04
Glimmer," Ha! Good one, Adora. ""Waterfall for showering.""  I'm right down the hall if you need anything. Night.",1,04
Adora, Wait--,1,04
Adora," Okay. This is different than the Fright Zone, but I'm sure I'll get the hang of this in no time.  Help.",1,04
Adora,"  Come on, get flatter! No! Go back in! Go back in!   Glimmer? Glimmer? I think I killed the bed.   Ma'am! I mean, Your Majesty. Sir!  So, what are you doing up?",1,04
Angella," When I feel the cares of the day weighing upon me, I come here.",1,04
Adora, Who is that?,1,04
Angella, King Micah. My husband. He built the Rebellion with me. And he was one of the first casualties of The Horde.,1,04
Adora, Sorry. I didn't know.,1,04
Angella," Adora. My daughter believes you can help us. Glimmer has vouched for you despite your background. And because I greatly love my daughter, I am willing to give you a chance. Do not disappoint her.",1,04
Adora,  Glimmer! Are you okay?,1,04
Glimmer, What are you doing in here?,1,04
Adora," I'm sorry! I couldn't sleep in my room. I've never slept without any other people around. And then I ran into your mom, I think she doesn't like me.",1,04
Glimmer, What? My mom loves you.,1,04
Adora," Yeah, sure. She loves She-Ra.",1,04
Glimmer," Mom can be... a little intense, heh. But, our weekly meeting with the Rebellion Generals is today and you're invited. She wouldn't have invited you if she didn't like you.",1,04
Adora, Wow. Heh.,1,04
Glimmer, Come on. Meeting's about to start.,1,04
Adora," Uh, the chairs are still empty.",1,04
Glimmer," Those are for the other Etherian Princesses, but... none of them have been active members since I was a kid. The Rebellion had a big defeat years ago, and most of the old Princesses gave up. Now all the kingdoms keep to themselves, and the new Princesses do the same.",1,04
Bow, Other than Spinnerella and Netossa.,1,04
Adora, Ah.,1,04
Adora, What? What? I don't understand.,1,04
Angella, This is not your chair.,1,04
Glimmer, Sorry! First day. Won't happen again!,1,04
Adora,  What did I do?,1,04
Glimmer,  You sat in my dad's chair.,1,04
Adora,  Oh... Oh. I'm sorry.,1,04
Angella, I've asked you here because I've received a distress call from Princess Perfuma. The Horde is laying siege to her kingdom. She's asking Bright Moon for assistance. General?,1,04
Bright Moon General," Perfuma's kingdom, Plumeria, is located near the front lines.The Horde has set up camp in their territory, cutting off their main supply route",1,04
Angella, Bright Moon will provide food and humanitarian aid.,1,04
Glimmer,  I have a better idea. We can--,1,04
Angella," Fight the Horde? Glimmer, you propose this idea every meeting.",1,04
Glimmer," No! I was going to say, let's use aggressive fist-to-face sparkles.",1,04
Angella," I said, no, Glimmer. Now sit down!",1,04
Adora," You should send me, Glimmer, and Bow to lead the relief mission.You can send me as She-Ra. I'll make sure everyone gets there safely and protect Bow and Glimmer if the Horde attacks. I promise, I won't disappoint you.",1,04
Angella,"  Very well. You will deliver food and supplies to Plumeria, and under no circumstances will you engage the Horde. You leave at dawn.",1,04
Kyle,  I give up! I give up!,1,04
Lonnie,"  Quit playing around, Kyle! Where's Catra? She's supposed to be here.",1,04
Catra," Not anymore, cadet Lonnie.",1,04
Lonnie, Why aren't you dressed?,1,04
Catra," Oh, Lonnie, Lonnie... sweet, dumb, Lonnie. ",1,04
Lonnie, They made you Force Captain?,1,04
Kyle," Congrats, Catra! ",1,04
Catra," Hordak knows a good thing when he sees it. Now that I'm in charge, Shadow Weaver won't be the only one...Uh...",1,04
Catra," What do ya need, Shadow Weaver? Ooh, are you giving me my first mission?",1,04
Shadow Weaver, You will explain how you lost Force Captain Adora.,1,04
Catra,"  Ugh, I've told you everything I know about Adora! ",1,04
Shadow Weaver, I know you're lying. You have to be lying. What happened to Adora? What did you do?,1,04
Catra, What did I do? She left us! She left me! You ever think Adora's not as loyal as you thought?,1,04
Shadow Weaver," I will learn the truth, Catra, even if I have to drag it from your--",1,04
Shadow Weaver, Out of my way!,1,04
Glimmer, Wow. Mom didn't say anything about all the plants dying.,1,04
Bow," I don't think she knows. Wait, where's Adora?",1,04
Glimmer, Are you gonna be She-Ra the entire time we're here?,1,04
She-Ra," I told Queen Angella I would. Besides, people like me better as She-Ra.  Could Adora do this? ",1,04
Glimmer, Hmm. Yep. Very useful to our mission.,1,04
Bow," Hey, guys. What is that?",1,04
She-Ra, Must be coming from the Horde camp.,1,04
Perfuma, You're here!,1,04
Glimmer, Princess Perfuma. I'm Commander Glimmer of--,1,04
Bow," Ooh, I get a hat.",1,04
Perfuma,"  Oh, my. Everyone, come quick! It's, Oh, it's… It's…  Look! The universe has heard our pleas and sent the legendary She-Ra to help us save our home.",1,04
She-Ra,  We heard about the blockade and we've come to help. We brought food and supplies for you.,1,04
Perfuma," Welcome to Plumeria, She-Ra.",1,04
She-Ra," Um, Glimmer, what's happening?",1,04
Perfuma," Come with me, I'll show you around. You're gonna love it.",1,04
Perfuma," Our people have lived here for thousands of years. We're known for our beautiful flowers, our majestic trees. And this is the Heart-Blossom, the center of our kingdom, and the source of all my magical powers.",1,04
Bow, At least this tree is fine. What happened to everything else?,1,04
Perfuma," We're going through a little rough patch, but I'm sure the universe will right itself soon.",1,04
Glimmer, Everything is dead or dying.,1,04
Perfuma," Look, the blight hit right after the Horde arrived. We don't know why, and nothing I do stops it. But we don't dwell on the negative. Look at the positive. The Heart-Blossom is still healthy, and the She-Ra is here, and the celebration's about to begin.",1,04
She-Ra, Celebration? ,1,04
Shadow Weaver, You will not refuse me!,1,04
Hordak, Shadow Weaver.,1,04
Shadow Weaver, Lord Hordak!,1,04
Hordak, You have disobeyed my orders.,1,04
Shadow Weaver," I've done no such thing, Lord Hordak. My will is your will.",1,04
Hordak, Then explain to me why you've requisitioned more troops to look for one missing soldier. A soldier I ordered you to give up on.,1,04
Shadow Weaver, Finding Adora is crucial to the Horde's mission—,1,04
Hordak,"  Our mission is to kill the Whispering Woods so we can march on Bright Moon. Our mission is to destroy the princesses and their ridiculous rebellion. You are distracted, Shadow Weaver. Our ground troops demand your full attention. The siege on Plumeria has carried on for too long. You will give the order to increase power until victory is achieved. And never forget, I gave you your magical power and at my slightest whim,  I can take it away.  Understand?",1,04
Shadow Weaver," Of course, Lord Hordak.",1,04
She-Ra," No, no, no, it's okay. You need this food more than we do.",1,04
Plumerian elder, Nonsense. It is our honor to serve the She-Ra.,1,04
She-Ra," No, no, no, it's okay. You need this food more than we do.",1,04
Plumerian elder, Nonsense. It is our honor to serve the She-Ra.,1,04
Perfuma, We are so honored to have you.,1,04
Plumerian Citizen 1, Whoa. That's She-Ra.,1,04
Perfuma," Yes, I know. The She-Ra, right? I'm so happy that after all these centuries of being gone, you've finally returned. I said, break out party kale. And at our hour of greatest need, just like in the stories.",1,04
She-Ra, What stories?,1,04
Perfuma," The stories we've been telling for thousands of years. She-Ra, the warrior who tamed the beasts of Beast Island with a single word.",1,04
Bow, That's nothing. What about the time She-Ra defeated a squad of Horde soldiers on a flying horse? Or the time she saved Thaymor from a legion of Horde soldiers? Or the time she borrowed my toothbrush and used it to defeat an army of Horde soldiers.,1,04
She-Ra," Uh, Bow, that's not true.",1,04
Bow, You're right. It was two armies!,1,04
She-Ra, Uh...,1,04
Glimmer," Hey, calm down! Give her some space. One at a time. You first.",1,04
She-Ra, Oh! Thank you for the…,1,04
Glimmer,  Windchime.,1,04
She-Ra, Wind-chime.,1,04
Perfuma, We're so excited for you to heal our land and bring all the plants back to life. Will you be doing it before the drum circle or after?,1,04
She-Ra, You want me to--You want me to heal your land?,1,04
Perfuma," Yes! Like in the ancient story, ""She-Ra Heals the Forest And Brings The Trees Back To Life.""",1,04
Glimmer,  I've seen her do way weirder stuff. This'll be a snap.,1,04
She-Ra," Wait, it's not that simple. Plus, I don't like the look of that smoke. The Horde's up to something big. Maybe we should investigate.",1,04
Perfuma, We? This is my power. I grow plants. We're not strong enough to go up against the Horde. All we want is to live peacefully in our ancestral home.,1,04
Bow, And then She-Ra saved the day once again!,1,04
Perfuma," We need you, She-Ra.",1,04
She-Ra," Yes, healing. That is a thing I know how to do. I just need to take Bow and Glimmer over to those trees for a moment. I know what I'm doing!",1,04
She-Ra,  I don't know what I'm doing! I can't heal anything!,1,04
Bow," But, the stories say you have healing powers.",1,04
She-Ra, They also say I fought the Mantisaur. I don't even know what that is!,1,04
Glimmer, Why don't you just concentrate really hard? That seems to work whenever you need to transform.,1,04
She-Ra,  Okay.,1,04
She-Ra, Did I do it?,1,04
Bow," No, you punched a tree. That's kinda the opposite of healing.",1,04
She-Ra, Let me try again. ,1,04
Glimmer, Magic blast. Also not healing.,1,04
She-Ra, I'll get it this time.,1,04
Glimmer, Magical transformation?,1,04
Bow," Wait, is that what happened to our horse?",1,04
Bow, It's okay. You'll get it soon.,1,04
She-Ra," Soon isn't good enough! These people expect me to save their land. I thought I was better as She-Ra, but I'm useless no matter what form I take.",1,04
Bow, My hat!,1,04
Perfuma, She-Ra! Come quickly! Something absolutely terrible has happened!,1,04
Perfuma," The Heart-Blossom is dying. Please, She-Ra, heal our land.",1,04
She-Ra," Oh, come on, do something.",1,04
She-Ra, No. ,1,04
Adora, Sorry. I don't know how to heal.,1,04
Plumerian Citizen 2, Who are you? And where's She-Ra?,1,04
Adora," My name is Adora. I was chosen to carry the sword of She-Ra, but... I haven't been doing this for very long, and I don't know exactly how it works yet.",1,04
Plumerian elder, She's just a girl!,1,04
Adora," I never meant to deceive you. I am She-Ra, I'm just not the same She-Ra.",1,04
Perfuma, Then you can't save us?,1,04
Adora," Wait! There might be another way. I know the Horde. I think they're using one of their machines to poison your land. If we wanna save your home, we have to stop them!",1,04
Plumerian Citizen 2, You're not She-Ra from the stories. You were supposed to save us.,1,04
Perfuma," It will be all right, I promise. We will rebuild. We have to believe that the universe will repay the Horde for their evil deeds eventually.",1,04
Glimmer," The universe won't protect you! You want She-Ra to fix everything, but won't even try to save yourselves? At least Adora's trying.",1,04
Perfuma," If She-Ra can't save us, no one can. Right now, we just need to make sure our people are safe. We leave today.",1,04
Glimmer, Are you okay?,1,04
Adora, I just wanted to help. But all I've done is disappoint an entire kingdom. I'm sorry I let you guys down after you talked me up.,1,04
Bow," We just wanted everyone to see what an awesome person you are. I thought I was being supportive, but I was being terrible!",1,04
Glimmer," Adora, She-Ra's not the reason we like you. We like you because you're our friend.",1,04
Glimmer," You have a plan, don't you?",1,04
Adora, Yeah. I think I do.,1,04
Adora," All clear. Okay, we need to find the machine. Every Horde camp is laid out the same. Guard duty's in half-hour shifts, so we walk in when the shift changes in three, two, one.",1,04
Horde soldier 1, Shift change!,1,04
Horde soldier 2, Finally! Boring shifts go by slower.,1,04
Glimmer,  You were right. The Horde is poisoning the land.,1,04
Horde soldier, Hey! What are you doing here?,1,04
Adora,"  What are you doing here? We have security clearance, password 5-echo-niner. On your way.",1,04
Horde solider, We haven't used that password in months. Hands up!,1,04
Bow, Adora? What do we do?,1,04
Adora, Run!,1,04
Plumerian Citizen 2," Hey, the Bright Moon guys left.",1,04
Perfuma," ""We've gone to the Horde camp to find the weapon killing your trees. If we don't make it, I wanted to say I'm sorry. I couldn't be the hero you wanted. -Adora."" She's still trying, even though we were so negative. Glimmer was right. This is our home, we can't let her do this alone! Everyone, She-Ra and our friends from Bright Moon are risking their lives to protect us from the Horde. We need to help them! Get the warchimes, we march!",1,04
Adora, How many soldiers can you take?,1,04
Bow, Between one and zero.  Whoo.,1,04
Glimmer,"  I'll take them all, if you give me a minute.",1,04
Perfuma," I've always said the universe will repay the Horde one day. Well, I guess that day is today!",1,04
Plumerian Child, For the She-Ra!,1,04
Glimmer, Hey. Ooh. ,1,04
Perfuma, I've never been so alive!,1,04
Adora,  For the honor of Grayskull!,1,04
She-Ra, For Etheria! ,1,04
Horde Soldier, Ew! Yuck!,1,04
Horde Soldier,  Retreat! Retreat!,1,04
Perfuma, Thank you so much! You inspired us to save ourselves. How can we ever repay you?,1,04
Glimmer," Join the Rebellion, and help me reform the Princess Alliance.",1,04
Perfuma," Um, are you sure? Didn't that go horribly the first time?",1,04
Glimmer, It went horribly for our parents. But we have a chance to do it right. We're clearly stronger together. Think what all the Princesses united could do.,1,04
Perfuma, Would I get to hit more people with flowers?,1,04
Glimmer, Absolutely.,1,04
Perfuma," You have a deal. Hey, everyone! Look at us. We're mighty rebels now.",1,04
Catra, Force Captain Catra reporting for--,1,04
Shadow Weaver," This was brought to me by retreating soldiers, retreating because their camp was attacked by Adora and She-Ra. Pathetic, you're still trying to protect her. Did you think you could keep the truth from me?",1,04
Catra," It's just a phase, she's confused. I'll bring her back in, I swear.",1,04
Shadow Weaver," Oh, yes, you will. Because until I tell you otherwise, that is your mission. And to ensure success, no matter where Adora goes, no matter how long it takes, my shadow spies will find her.",1,04
Shadow Weaver, Find her and bring her home.,1,04
Adora, What is this? ,1,04
Glimmer," Since you've never slept in a room by yourself before, Bow and I thought we'd throw you a sleepover, then you won't feel so alone.",1,04
Bow, We even got you a new bed.,1,04
Adora,  It's wonderful.,1,04
Bow," We can do this tomorrow too, since Glimmer's grounded for ignoring orders.",1,04
Glimmer, For one week.That's three weeks less than normal. And Mom said she'd consider my plan to recruit new Princesses into the rebellion!,1,04
Adora," Thanks, guys. I might not ever be the perfect hero everybody wants me to be, but that's okay.",1,04
Glimmer, Of course it's okay. Do you have any idea how annoying you'd be if you were perfect?,1,04
Bow, Aw! Best Friend Squad is having a pillow fight!,1,04
Adora," Yeah, we're not calling ourselves that.",1,04
Glimmer," I prefer ""The Glimmer Group.”",1,04
Bow, Nah. We're the Best Friend Squad.,1,04
Angella," Council, we're looking for plans to strengthen our defenses against the Horde. Who would like to go first?",1,05
Glimmer," Me, me, me. Me. Me, me.",1,05
Angella, Who besides Glimmer would like to go first?,1,05
Glimmer," Mom-- Uh, eugh, your majesty. You should let me, Bow, and Adora continue our princess recruitment mission. If we can form a new Princess Alliance, The Rebellion would actually stand a chance for once.",1,05
Angella, The princesses withdrew from the last alliance. They chose to focus on protecting their own lands.,1,05
Glimmer," So, are we supposed to just... give up? Please, let me try. All I'm proposing is a diplomatic mission.",1,05
Angella,"  So, what do you propose?",1,05
Glimmer," Anyone approaching Bright Moon by sea needs to pass through the Salineas Sea Gate. It's controlled by Mermista now that her father's retired. With her on our side, the Rebellion could control the seas. We NEED this alliance with her, Mom.",1,05
Angella," The journey is treacherous, Glimmer. I'm not sure.",1,05
Glimmer," Don't worry, Mom. With She-Ra, we can conquer anything.",1,05
Adora," And, uh, we're also gonna need a boat.",1,05
Glimmer," With She-Ra and a boat, we can conquer anything.",1,05
Bow, Aaaaand an experienced sea captain.,1,05
Glimmer," With She-Ra, a boat, and an experienced sea captain,  we can conquer anything.",1,05
Angella,  Very well.,1,05
Glimmer, Yes!,1,05
Angella," I mean it, Glimmer. No violence, and no collateral damage.",1,05
Glimmer,"  Thanks, Mom, you won't regret it.",1,05
Bow, This is so cool. Seaworthy is just like I imagined it. Everyone here looks like a real pirate!,1,05
Glimmer," Focus, Bow. We're just here to find a sea captain.",1,05
Bow, No pirates?,1,05
Glimmer, No pirates.,1,05
Bow,  Arrrr.,1,05
Adora, None of these people look qualified to sail a ship.,1,05
Glimmer, Excuse me.,1,05
Glimmer," Er, we're looking for a sea captain to take us to Salineas.",1,05
Sea Hawk, I won. Drinks all around. Put it on my friend here's tab.,1,05
Glimmer," Uh,  hiiii. We were told you're a sea captain?",1,05
Sea Hawk, I am the one and only Sea Hawk.,1,05
Sea Hawk, Has my reputation preceded me?,1,05
Bow,  Your name is Sea Hawk? That's the coolest name I've ever heard!,1,05
Glimmer," Captain Sea Hawk, we're interviewing potential captains to take us to Salineas. Would you like to apply for the position?",1,05
Sea Hawk,  Apply for the position? I am the one and only Sea Hawk. I'm offer only.,1,05
Adora,"  Okay. Just because ""Sea"" is in your name, doesn't tell us anything about your ACTUAL qualifications.",1,05
Sea Hawk," Qualifications? I once ran the 50-klick Galebreath Gauntlet in less than 20 klicks. I maneuvered the straits of Serpentine with nary a chip in the paint of my bow. My shanties are considered so desirable, that sirens fling THEMSELVES into the sea at the sound of them. And because I can tell you're wondering, my mustache is... naturally shiny.",1,05
Bow, It IS shiny. You're hired.,1,05
Bow, Ow.,1,05
Sea Hawk," Whoa, there, kids. What makes you think you can afford me?",1,05
Glimmer," I assure you, Captain Sea Hawk, money is no object.",1,05
Sea Hawk, Behold my fee.,1,05
Glimmer," Money might be an object. You know what, fine. We'll just find ANOTHER sea captain.",1,05
Sea Hawk," Good luck with that. You won't find another soul who knows the treacherous route to Salineas as well as I do. I brave it often to visit my close personal friend, Princess Mermista.",1,05
Glimmer,  You know her?,1,05
Sea Hawk, Uh do I?,1,05
Adora," Okay, well, here's the deal. We go one round, winner takes all. You win, we leave you alone. I win, you take us to Salineas. At no cost.",1,05
Sea Hawk," That's a terrible deal. But I am undefeated at arm wrestling. Let me show you how it's done, lassie.",1,05
Bow," Go Adoraaaa, put him in the dirt.",1,05
Glimmer, This is so dumb.,1,05
Sea Hawk, Ha! Is this the best you've got? I once beat a Tyrosaur with biceps the size of my head in an arm-wrestling match that lasted two weeks.,1,05
Adora, Ha!,1,05
Bow, Yeah! ,1,05
Sea Hawk,"  Well, truth be told, I let you win so as to, ahem, boost your confidence.  I've been wanting to go to Salineas anyway.  Come on, kids, with me! Forward to adventure!",1,05
Shadow Weaver, Adora is in Seaworthy. I'm giving you one more chance to bring her back.,1,05
Catra, Uh...didn't Hordak just order to you to stop going after Adora?,1,05
Shadow Weaver, And who is going to tell him? You?,1,05
Catra, Fine. About time you started treating me like a Force Captain anyway. I'll bring her back.,1,05
Shadow Weaver,  Not so faaast. You won't be going alone. You'll be joined by Force Captain Scorpia.,1,05
Scorpia,"  ...KITTY!  Just so you know, I'm a hugger.",1,05
Catra, Is this some kind of joke?!,1,05
Shadow Weaver, Scorpia will see that you are...kept in line.,1,05
Catra,"  Ugh. Okay, whatever. You're at least giving me a vehicle, right?",1,05
Shadow Weaver, Something like that.,1,05
Catra,  No...not--,1,05
Scorpia," BOATS! Oh, I just love boats, don't you?  Wind in your hair,  ocean on every side, miles and miles from the nearest dry land... watery death awaiting at the slightest mishap... Man... that's what I call living.",1,05
Catra,"  Yeah, I'm really gonna need you to shut up...",1,05
Scorpia,"  Aw, are you seasick?",1,05
Scorpia," Now, just focus on me, okay? It'll help.",1,05
Catra,  Put me down!  What is wrong with you?,1,05
Catra, What are you looking at?  Get back to doing boat things.,1,05
Sea Hawk,  Welcome aboard The Dragon's Daughter...III.,1,05
Adora,  What happened to The Dragon's Daughters I and II?,1,05
Sea Hawk," Tragically, they went down in flames...",1,05
Bow,  How did that happen?,1,05
Sea Hawk,  I set them on fire.  ADVENTURE!,1,05
Adora,  Are we sure about this guy?,1,05
Glimmer,  He just needs to get us there.,1,05
Sea Hawk, You'll of course be expected to earn your keep by helping out around the ship. Never fear I will teach you everything you need to know...in shanty form!  Oooooh--!  --What are you doing?,1,05
Bow," Oh. I noticed your mainsail wasn't secured, so I fixed it.",1,05
Sea Hawk, Tying proper knots is a task that takes years to master... You did these just now?!,1,05
Bow, Yes!  Sea Hawk is impressed with my knots! This is the best day of my life!,1,05
Sea Hawk," Excellent work.  Even if it is just beginner's luck...  We'll also need to set a lookout.  Come on, Sparkle,  we'll sing a shanty duet and I'll show you how to climb the ratlines...  Ooooooh--!",1,05
Sea Hawk," Wait, how did she--",1,05
Adora,  I unfurled the jib.,1,05
Sea Hawk, By yourself?  Not even a sailor as experienced as...me could do that.,1,05
Adora,"  Oh, so what you're saying is  I'm better at this than you are?",1,05
Glimmer,  And the name is Glimmer.,1,05
Sea Hawk," Well, you are a strangely overqualified crew. ...What do you even need old Sea Hawk for?",1,05
Glimmer,"  Your map? Can we focus on our super important mission, here? More sailing, less shanty-ing.",1,05
Sea Hawk,"  Of course, Shimmer! A top secret mission from the Queen! I'll get you there straight away. I'm as excited to see my dearest Mermista as  I know she is to see me.",1,05
Glimmer,  My name is Glimmer--!,1,05
Sea Hawk,  Oooooooh!,1,05
Glimmer," Something's wrong... According to the map, we're way off-course.",1,05
Bow,"  WHOO! Yeah, let's go! Go, Adora. Yeah!",1,05
Adora,  Ha! Yes!,1,05
Sea Hawk,  Best three out of five!,1,05
Glimmer,  No! No more arm-wrestling. I spotted a ship graveyard in the distance and we're heading straight for it.  Is anyone worried about this?!,1,05
Glimmer,  What was that?!,1,05
Sea Hawk,  Aha! We're here.,1,05
Sea Hawk, The Serpent of the Sea. I knew he'd be lurking in these waters.,1,05
Glimmer,"  Wait, you brought us here on purpose?!",1,05
Sea Hawk," You see, I don't just provide sea transport.  I give you a tale to tell your friends!  Come on, crew. We're in for a harrowing ADVENTURE!",1,05
Adora,  For the Honor of Grayskull!,1,05
She-Ra,  Waaatch thiiiiis!,1,05
Sea Hawk, Is that a normal thing she does?,1,05
Bow, Yeah. It takes some getting used to.,1,05
She-Ra,"  Got it!  Wait, no--!",1,05
Glimmer,"  Let me get this straight. You steered us into a giant sea serpent just so you could, what, show off?!",1,05
Sea Hawk,"  That was the plan, until your tall friend there STOLE my THUNDER!",1,05
Glimmer,  Unbelievable. We're trying to save Etheria and all you care about is whether we're impressed with you?! I need this mission to go right  or my mom will never give me another one!  Just get us to Salineas. You've wasted enough of our time.,1,05
Adora,"  Okay! Now, I got it.  We're all good.",1,05
Glimmer,  Adora--! Get in the boat!,1,05
Catra,  Why have we stopped?,1,05
Kyle," The Sea Gate is blocking our path. ...There's no way past, Force Captain Catra.",1,05
Catra,"  What?!  Oh, Shadow Weaver didn't bother to mention that there was a massive gate blocking the way to Seaworthy?",1,05
Scorpia,"  Wait, didn't you learn about the Salineas Sea Gate in Force Captain Orientation?",1,05
Catra, There's a Force Captain Orientation?!,1,05
Scorpia,"  Oho, yes there is!",1,05
Catra,  All hands on deck! We're finding a way through that gate.,1,05
Scorpia,"  Oo, impressive Captain yell.",1,05
Bow, ...Where is everyone?,1,05
Sea Hawk," Hmm...very odd, indeed. If I know the princess Mermista--and I-I do--something's amiss.",1,05
Salineas Guard,"  Halt! Halt! Halt, I say!  ...Halt...  ...What's your business in Salineas?",1,05
Glimmer, We've come to speak with Princess Mermista--,1,05
Sea Hawk,"  Tell her Sea Hawk is with them, she'll be excited to see me.",1,05
Mermista,"  Ew, who let him back in here?",1,05
Sea Hawk," Princess! Oh, it's been too long. I have dreamed of you night and day since we parted.",1,05
Mermista, Uh-huh...  And who are you?,1,05
Glimmer," My name is Glimmer of Bright Moon. We've never met, but our parents fought in the Rebellion together.",1,05
Mermista,"  Oh, yeah... I remember hearing about the old Princess Alliance. My dad said it was a total disaster.",1,05
Sea Hawk,  I didn't think it was possible but your beauty grows greater with each passing day--,1,05
Mermista, Will you quit it? I'm trying to talk to my new friend Twinkle. ...Butler  can you bring us some hors-d'oeuvres? ,1,05
Sea Hawk,"  Oooo, hors-d'oeuvres!",1,05
Mermista, For everyone but Sea Hawk.,1,05
Bow, Your guard is also your butler?,1,05
Mermista, I'm a little understaffed right now.  Everybody fled because the Gate is falling apart or whatever... ,1,05
"Adora, Glimmer, and Bow", What?!,1,05
Mermista,"  Yeah, I know, right?  It figures that I would inherit a kingdom that's crumbling, but it's totally fine--I'm...handling it. It's just kind of inconvenient because the Horde won't stop attacking us...",1,05
Glimmer, Why is the gate falling apart?,1,05
Mermista," I mean, who knows, but it's getting weaker everyday, and if the Horde tries to attack us again, we're pretty much dead.",1,05
Glimmer," The Horde is the reason we're here. We want to rebuild the Princess Alliance. None of us stand a chance on our own, but we might be able to stop them together.",1,05
Mermista,"  Yeah, cause that went so great the first time. Why should I help Bright Moon? It's not like they've ever done anything to help us.",1,05
Sea Hawk," Mermista, if I may--",1,05
Mermista," No, no more shanties.  Why did you bring him here? He is so  annoying...",1,05
Bow,  I thought you said she liked you?,1,05
Sea Hawk, We have a rich and complicated past.,1,05
Mermista,"  If by that you mean you got us kicked out of the Dolphin Social for challenging the doorman to a duel, then sure.",1,05
Sea Hawk,  ...I don't recall doing that.,1,05
Mermista, And that time that you set our gondola on fire in the Tunnel of Love? ,1,05
Sea Hawk,  Ooo...that I do recall.,1,05
Adora,  ...This is First One's writing.,1,05
Mermista," And, who is she again? What is she doing?",1,05
Bow, That's Adora. She has a magic sword.,1,05
Glimmer,  What does it say?,1,05
Adora,  Uh...it's something about the Gate... The First Ones must have built it. It looks like the Gate gets its power from the Salinean Runestone... It could be that the Gate is failing because it's losing its connection to the power source.,1,05
Glimmer, Do you think you can fix it?,1,05
Adora,  I can try...,1,05
Glimmer,"  Look, Mermista. You need our help, and we need yours. If Adora can repair your gate, will you consider joining us? Please?",1,05
Mermista,  I don't know...I guess...  But he has to leave.,1,05
Sea Hawk,  But...where am I supposed to go?,1,05
Bow,"  ...Maybe wait with the boat, okay, buddy? We'll take care of the gate.",1,05
Mermista, I really hope you know what you're doing.,1,05
Adora,"  Uh...yeah, totally.  I got this... For the Honor...of Grayskull!",1,05
Mermista, Wow. Okay. That's...different.,1,05
Bow, ...Is it working?,1,05
She-Ra,  Don't distract me...this is a lot harder than it looks...,1,05
Glimmer,  This might take a while.  Ugh. Hang on.  Where are you going?,1,05
Sea Hawk,  I'd really appreciate it if you'd stop doing that.,1,05
Glimmer, Are you leaving without us?,1,05
Glimmer,  Yeah...I know a little about that. I can't get anyone to take me seriously either.,1,05
Sea Hawk, You? But you're a princess....,1,05
Glimmer," Try being the daughter of an immortal queen, when your powers are  ""sparkles.""",1,05
Sea Hawk, Glitter--,1,05
Glimmer,  Glimmer.,1,05
Sea Hawk," --we just met, but I can tell you are a brave and powerful soul. Anyone who'd underestimate you would live to sorely regret it.",1,05
Glimmer," Thanks, Sea Hawk. And you know what? You still have friends and a crew.  Reporting for duty, Captain!",1,05
Bow,  Uh...Adora?,1,05
Bow,  It's the Horde!,1,05
Glimmer, What?!,1,05
Catra,  Keep us going full-speed. I've got something more important to do. ,1,05
Bow,  They're coming for the gate!,1,05
She-Ra,  I just need a little more time.  Keep them busy.,1,05
Scorpia," Oh, come on.",1,05
Bow, Oh. ...You're big.,1,05
Scorpia, See ya!,1,05
Sea Hawk, Gotcha.,1,05
Bow,  Sea Hawk!,1,05
Glimmer, Bow! Are you all right?,1,05
Bow,  That was... AMAZING!,1,05
Sea Hawk," Thank you for noticing, Bow. It was amazing.",1,05
Sea Hawk, Nothing's slowing them down. What do we do?,1,05
Glimmer," I think I have a plan. But no one is allowed to tell my mom about this. Sea Hawk, I need your help. I need you to do what you do best.",1,05
Sea Hawk, What?,1,05
Glimmer,  Set your ship on fire.,1,05
Sea Hawk,  Yes!,1,05
Catra,"  Wow. You know, the tiara actually gets stupider the more I look at it.",1,05
She-Ra,  Catra... How did you find me? ,1,05
Catra," Did you think it would be that easy to escape the Horde? I mean, I always knew you were kinda dumb, but...  come on.",1,05
She-Ra," What's your plan, insult me until I decide to rejoin the Horde?",1,05
Catra," I don't think Shadow Weaver is planning to give you much of a choice. But, yeah, something like that.",1,05
Catra,"  Check it out. Looks like with you gone, I got your promotion. ",1,05
She-Ra,  Congratulations.,1,05
Catra," Seems like only yesterday this was the thing you wanted most in the world. And now you're-- ugh. Come on, Adora, hasn't this all gone on long enough?",1,05
She-Ra," I told you before, Catra.  I'm not. Going. Back.",1,05
Catra,  This is what you left me for? Dress-up games and a light show?  And your new friends are nowhere to be seen.  When did you get so weak?,1,05
She-Ra,  Thanks.,1,05
Mermista,"  Yeah, whatever, don't mention it.",1,05
Sea Hawk, Ha ha!,1,05
Glimmer and Sea Hawk,  Adventure!,1,05
Lonnie, What the heck?!,1,05
Mermista," Yay, that was cool. I'm...over it, though.",1,05
Mermista," Huh, what do you know, you actually fixed it.",1,05
Adora, It's beautiful.,1,05
Mermista,  I guess you're gonna be needing a new ship?  I suppose you can have one of mine...,1,05
Sea Hawk,  ...She's gorgeous...,1,05
Mermista, Don't set it on fire.,1,05
Sea Hawk,"  No promises.  But, Princess,  if I might ask for one more favor?",1,05
Mermista,  You're always ruining it.,1,05
Sea Hawk,"  You should think about joining Glimmer's Princess Alliance.  She is a brave and strong captain.  With her at the helm, she is sure to lead the Rebellion to victory.",1,05
Glimmer," Aw, Sea Hawk...  You even got my name right.",1,05
Mermista," Okay, I'm in.",1,05
Glimmer, Really?,1,05
Mermista," Yeah. The Horde almost destroyed my home. I wanna help fight them.  Plus, your friend over there can turn into like an eight-foot tall lady with a sword, and I want her on my side.",1,05
Mermista," Wow, okay, calm down.",1,05
Glimmer," You won't regret this, I promise.",1,05
Bow and Sea Hawk,"  The Best Friends Squad on the seas We subdued the threat / The threat with ease! We sail the world / Come near or far We're Best Friends / We are, we areWe're Best Friends / We are, we are!",1,05
Busgirl," Oh, I got it",1,06
Soda Pop, Don't forget this.,1,06
Baker," Oh, buttered biscuits.  I'll never get used to these things.",1,06
Soda Pop, At least I don't have to get lost in that maze of hers anymore.,1,06
Entrapta, A pig.  So cute.,1,06
Entrapta," Log.  Day 103. 104? No, definitely 103.    First Ones artifact number 58 has yielded a treasure trove of intact code.    If I can successfully translate it, it could hold the secrets of the First Ones.",1,06
Entrapta," Fascinating, my roots seem to be responding to the code.    This is remarkable.    Could this be my biggest step yet in making ancient and modern technology truly compatible?",1,06
Entrapta," Edit to log, I am now going to run.",1,06
Glimmer, Princess Entrapta will be a total catch for the Rebellion.  My mother is going to be so impressed!,1,06
Adora," Uh, I'm all for impressing Angella, but why is Entrapta so important?",1,06
Bow," She's a brilliant inventor.  She makes robots and rehabs old tech left by the First Ones.  She's a pretty big deal in the Etherian makers community. Which I am a part of, because I dabble in gadgetry myself.",1,06
Adora,  What does any of that mean?,1,06
Glimmer," It means, if we convince Entrapta to join the Rebellion, she'll invent all sorts of cool junk for us.  And then we'll finally have weapons that can stand up to the Horde's.",1,06
Bow," Like my trick arrows!  I'm running low so I built some new ones. This one is a stun arrow.  This one is an emergency flare.  And this one, this one's just pointy. And here is my newest one. Sonic arrow!",1,06
Glimmer,  When will we ever need a sonic arrow.  If we have to wake up really early?,1,06
Adora,  Or if we get separated in a crowd?,1,06
Bow," ""Separated in a crowd"".  I bet Entrapta will like my arrows.",1,06
Bow, Must have been a rock slide.  Any loud sound could cause another slide. We need to be as quiet as -,1,06
Adora, FOR THE HONOR OF GRAYSKULL!,1,06
She-Ra, Ha! I'm getting the hang of this.,1,06
Bow, That was incredibly dangerous.,1,06
She-Ra, What's the big deal? It worked.,1,06
Bow, You can't just bust through everything with magic.  She-Ra could have caused an avalanche.,1,06
She-Ra," But she didn't, OK?  I've spent my whole life without powers.  No way I'm going to stop using them now.",1,06
Bow," Whoa, she's got lightning.",1,06
Glimmer, Something's wrong.  The castle's distress beacon is lit.  They must be under attack.,1,06
She-Ra, There's been no reports of the Horde in this area.,1,06
Bow," No, be careful!",1,06
Glimmer, You okay?,1,06
She-Ra, This place feels wrong... It's nothing.,1,06
She-Ra," Hey, who's there?",1,06
Glimmer," Hello?  Princess Entrapta.  We're here to, uh, recruit you for the Rebellion.",1,06
Bow," Okay, we need to be careful.  Entrapta has traps set up all over her castle.  They're supposed to be really cool.",1,06
Random person from sewer, They're coming.  Get out of the square.,1,06
She-Ra, Who's coming?  Is it the Horde?,1,06
Glimmer, Hello?  Come back.,1,06
Glimmer, I'm thinking we should probably move away from whatever is making that sound.,1,06
She-Ra, This way.,1,06
She-Ra, What the-,1,06
Bow, Looks like one of Entrapta's designs.  Why would it attack us?,1,06
She-Ra," Alright, stand back.",1,06
Bow," Careful, it could be a-",1,06
Bow, Glimmer!  Adora!,1,06
Glimmer, Bow!  He's all alone with those things!  He needs us!,1,06
She-Ra, We have to get out of here first.,1,06
Glimmer," Come on, I'll teleport us out.",1,06
She-Ra," Uh, is this out?",1,06
Glimmer, Ugh.,1,06
Glimmer," Princess Entrapta?  I mean, so good to see you.  I hope you don't mind, but we sort of let ourselves in.",1,06
She-Ra," And then we let ourselves out of your cage, trap thing.",1,06
Entrapta," Welcome to Dryl!    Things are usually really fun around here, but right now it's all kind of teensy bit deadly.",1,06
Bow, Let me go.,1,06
Soda Pop, Please keep your voice down sir.     The robots respond to sound.,1,06
Baker, We're just trying to help you.,1,06
Bow," Oh, thanks?  What's going on?  Why are the robots attacking people?",1,06
Busgirl, We don't know.  We're just the kitchen staff.,1,06
Baker, Miniature cupcake? Princess Entrapta only eats tiny food.,1,06
Soda Pop, And delicious fizzy beverages.,1,06
Bow," Uh, thank you?",1,06
Baker," You'll be safe in here with us.  We've got enough food to last for months.  It's tiny, but still.",1,06
Busgirl," The bots will run out of power eventually, right?",1,06
Bow, We need to do something.  You can't just hide in here forever.,1,06
Busgirl, Oh yes we can.  We don't have powers like the princesses.  We can't - fight.,1,06
Soda Pop," Sir, kindly quiet your whatever that is.",1,06
Bow, It's a tracker pad.  It tracks energy signatures from magic.    It will help me find my friends.,1,06
Baker, Are those little dot thingies your friends?,1,06
Bow, Gonna go with no.,1,06
Entrapta, You're lucky I found you.  I designed the castle as a labyrinth.  I'm the only one who can navigate it.,1,06
Glimmer, Which means you can help us find our friend?,1,06
Entrapta, Absolutely,1,06
She-Ra, Is she sure about that?,1,06
Glimmer," Hi, um, I think we passed this picture already.",1,06
Entrapta," Oh, isn't it cute? You might be right.  I usually have my electronic map to get around.  But, well, like my bots it's sort of evil right now.",1,06
Glimmer," Yeah, about that-",1,06
She-Ra, Why did you invent killer robots?,1,06
Entrapta," You're abnormally tall.  Hello! I like your sword.  It's First One tech, right?  Can I touch it?",1,06
She-Ra," Uh, thank you, yes, and no, not right now.",1,06
Glimmer, About the killer robots?,1,06
Entrapta," They didn't start out that way.  Usually they're super useful.  They do almost everything for me.  Cleaning, filing, basic hygiene.  Oh, and they're sound activated.  Here, I'll show you!",1,06
Glimmer," Uh, can we maybe not do that?",1,06
Entrapta,  Isn't it adorable?,1,06
Entrapta, It's trying to talk!,1,06
Glimmer," Whatever it's saying, I don't think it's good.",1,06
She-Ra, Make it stop.,1,06
Glimmer, Make what stop?,1,06
Entrapta, Bot 329 is attempting to communicate.,1,06
Entrapta," Oh no, bad bot.",1,06
She-Ra, Princess!,1,06
Glimmer, She-Ra!  Stop!,1,06
Baker," Oh, the door won't hold much longer.",1,06
Bow, Almost done.,1,06
Soda Pop, Are you sure about this?,1,06
Baker," Uh, you guys",1,06
Bow, Now!,1,06
Baker, Here goes nothing.,1,06
Soda Pop, Shoot it already.,1,06
Bow," I can't, it's a sonic arrow, it'll draw more bots.",1,06
Busgirl," Is it over?  I did that?  Hey, I did that!",1,06
Bow," Nice work, now let's find my friends!  Come on.",1,06
Glimmer," Adora?  Wake up, please wake up!",1,06
Entrapta, The tall one seems infected too.  She turned less tall. How does it work?,1,06
Glimmer," She's not an it, she's my friend. And what do you mean she's infected too?",1,06
Entrapta, It's really fascinating. I've been experimenting with a disc that was recovered from a mine in Dryl. It was a game-changer. It held more complete First One's code than anything I've ever seen before. But it seems to have reacted with the First Ones tech that powers my bots. It infected them with some sort of a virus.,1,06
Glimmer, But why would it make She-Ra sick?,1,06
Entrapta," Well, I'd have to take her apart to be sure.    But since her sword is First One's tech, it must have spread through that.",1,06
Glimmer," First, you're not taking her apart. She is a PERSON!    Second, if we destroy this disc, will that turn off the bots and stop the virus?",1,06
Entrapta, Destroy it? But the experiment isn't complete!,1,06
Glimmer, I think we can safely say that this experiment is a failure!,1,06
Entrapta," But what if it's not- no, you're right, it's a failure.",1,06
Adora," Glimmer, there's two of you.  That's nice.",1,06
Glimmer, How are you feeling?,1,06
Adora, Just peachy.  Why are we whispering?,1,06
Glimmer, Sound activates the robots.,1,06
Adora, What ROBOTS?,1,06
Glimmer, The ones that are attacking us.,1,06
Adora," Oh, those robots.  Okay, I'm going to take a nap now.",1,06
Glimmer," No no no no, stay awake, we have to go to Entrapta's lab and destroy this disc thing and then you'll be all better again.",1,06
Adora," Better?  I'm fine.  I'm She-Ra.   Hi, Glimmer.",1,06
Glimmer," Come on, we've got to get to your lab.  She's getting worse.",1,06
Entrapta, A-ha!,1,06
Entrapta," Oh, we're here.  I mean, uh, of course we're here.  We were never lost.",1,06
Entrapta," Wow, the door is infected too, it won't let us in.  That is so smart.  And awful.  We're all going to die.",1,06
Glimmer," It's okay, I've got this one.  I'll just teleport into the lab.",1,06
Entrapta," Ooo, teleportation.  How does that work?  Tell me everything.",1,06
Glimmer," Sure, but maybe later, when we're not, like, facing a robot uprising.",1,06
Entrapta, It's a date.,1,06
Glimmer, I'll be right back.,1,06
Adora," Okay, I'm just gonna wait here.",1,06
Glimmer, That was not such a great plan.  The lab is very full of robots.,1,06
Entrapta, How did they look?,1,06
Glimmer, Pretty evil.  I couldn't get anywhere near the disc.,1,06
Bow," No, that's Glimmer teleporting.  I know where Glimmer and Adora are.  Uh oh, that's not good. We have to do something, we have to save them.",1,06
Busgirl," Oh no, sir, no thank you.",1,06
Soda Pop," It's one thing to fight them off out of necessity, but to seek out danger?  It's madness.  Pardon me.",1,06
Baker," Look, they're princesses, they have powers.  I make baked goods.",1,06
Bow," Sure, we don't have powers like the princess, but that never stopped me, and  it doesn't have to stop you.",1,06
Baker," But you're a master archer, we're just ordinary people.",1,06
Bow," I'm a master archer who's out of arrows, but that never stopped me either. You each have a skill that only you can do, even if it doesn't come from some magical jewel.  You say you're just ordinary people, I say you're warriors of the Rebellion!",1,06
Baker, To the Rebellion!,1,06
Entrapta," Incredible development, the bots seem to be working together.",1,06
Glimmer," Right now, I think that's a bad thing.  We need to find another way into the lab.",1,06
Entrapta," The air duct, we can use that.",1,06
Entrapta, I don't suppose you have any other magical powers that could be useful right now?,1,06
Glimmer, I don't have enough energy to teleport us all.  Not without leaving someone's legs behind.,1,06
Entrapta, I'll give up one of mine if you give up one of yours.,1,06
Glimmer, It's Bow!,1,06
Adora," Yay, there's a rainbow!",1,06
Bow, Nice!,1,06
Glimmer, Bow!  You're okay!  I was so worried.,1,06
Bow," Big fan of your work, Princess Entrapta.  Uh, maybe not this work, exactly, but your other work.",1,06
Entrapta, Hi.,1,06
Adora, Hi,1,06
Bow," You okay, Adora?",1,06
Adora," Oh, yeah, sure, I'm totally",1,06
Glimmer," Entrapta was experimenting with First One's tech, and it infected all of her machines with some kind of virus, and She-Ra's sword got infected to and made Adora all, oh, weird. I teleported into the lab and it's full of bots and maybe we She-Ra we'd have a chance, but without her, it's hopeless.",1,06
Bow, We don't need She-Ra.  We can do this together.,1,06
Bow," Okay, where's the disc?",1,06
Entrapta, How fascinating.  It has completed protected itself.,1,06
Bow, We have to find a way to turn it off.,1,06
Adora," Hey, guys, I've found the bots.",1,06
Glimmer, Adora!,1,06
Glimmer, Shhh,1,06
Bow, Glimmer!,1,06
Baker, We'll get your friends.  You two get that disc turned off.,1,06
Bow, Keep 'em busy.,1,06
Busgirl," We got your back, princesses.",1,06
Glimmer," You dumb bots, you're going the wrong way!  Bow, watch out!",1,06
Bow," Uh, why isn't the computer turning off.",1,06
Entrapta,  It's running on its own power now!  That's it.  We need to get outta here and burn this place to the ground.  Experiment officially failed.,1,06
Bow," Wait, I have an idea.",1,06
Bow, Now's your chance sonic arrow!  I believe in you!,1,06
Adora, Where am I?  What's happening?,1,06
Glimmer," Thanks, former tall one, and companions, for saving our lives.  I would be honored to join your Rebellion and provide you with weapons.",1,06
Bow," Thanks, guys. You saved us all back there.  The Rebellion needs regular people now more than ever.",1,06
Busgirl, We are ready.,1,06
Glimmer," So, maybe you had a point before.",1,06
Bow," What?  I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.",1,06
Adora," I think what Glimmer is trying to say is that you were right, we can't always rely on our powers.",1,06
Bow," Ooohhh, is that what you were trying to say Glimmer?  That I was right?",1,06
Glimmer, Yes.,1,06
Bow, And my sonic arrow was a great idea?,1,06
Glimmer," Yes, it was brilliant, and you were totally right, okay?",1,06
Adora," If you hadn't come, the bots would have gotten us for sure.  And, I didn't know that She-Ra could get sick like that.  What if it happens again?",1,06
Bow," It won't.  We destroyed that evil, She-Ra hating disc.",1,06
Adora," Good, I never want to feel that way again.",1,06
Glimmer," Thanks for saving us, Bow.",1,06
Bow, All in a day's work for Bow and his band of Kitchen Knights! His Baking Brigade! Pastry Patrol!  I'm still working that out.,1,06
Glimmer," Oh, look at that rock just staring at us.      Boy, that rock really needs smashing.  And since She-Ra's not sick anymore, she should probably smash it!",1,06
Adora, A-ha!  What?  it's practise.  For the honor of Grayskull!,1,06
Entrapta," Log.  Day 105.  104?  Eh.    The last experiment hit a few bumps, but it was not a total failure.  I made some important discoveries.  The disc is way more powerful than I ever imagined.    With a few adjustments, I'm sure the next experiment will be a success.",1,06
Shadow Weaver's disembodied voice, Adora,1,07
Bow , Good morning Glimmer.,1,07
Glimmer, Noooo. It's too early. Five more minutes.,1,07
Bow, But it's a beautiful morning.,1,07
Glimmer, Today's cancelled. Go back to bed. I can feel you staring at me. Why is it the one who snores is always the first one to fall asleep?,1,07
Bow," What? I don't snore. Adora, do I snore? Adora?",1,07
Glimmer," Sorry, too early to teleport.",1,07
Bow, What are we looking at?,1,07
Adora, I don't know. I heard a noise in the woods last night. And I thought I saw something.,1,07
Glimmer," What? Like a bunny? Maybe a butterfly? Adora, did you get any sleep at all?",1,07
Adora, Someone has to stand guard.,1,07
Glimmer," Okay, I know you're on edge because of what happened with Entrapta's infected robots, but it's all over now. You've got to relax. You need a vacation. Which is why we're going to Mystacor.",1,07
Bow , Mystacor? No way.,1,07
Adora," Wait, what's Mystacor?",1,07
Glimmer," It's a secret floating kingdom that's home to all of Etheria's sorcerers. It's got tranquil gardens, beautiful beaches and healing springs. And my aunt Castaspella just happens to be the head sorceress there.",1,07
Bow," You'll love it Adora. Plus you won't have to worry about evil things in the woods. Mystacor is protected by an invisibility spell, so evil can't find it.",1,07
Glimmer, It's the safest and most peaceful place in all of Etheria. We'll have you relaxed in no time.,1,07
Adora," You know I've never relaxed in my life, right?",1,07
Bow," Well, we're here to change that. Just wait.",1,07
Catra," Shadow Weaver, you wanted to see me?",1,07
Shadow Weaver, Ah. Force Captain. How kind of you to join me.,1,07
Catra, What's up with you? You're being spookier than usual.,1,07
Shadow Weaver, My shadow spies have found Adora. She's on her way to Mystacor with her new friends. Mystacor. This is going to be too easy.,1,07
Catra, Another Adora mission. Fine. When do I leave?,1,07
Shadow Weaver," The only place you're headed is outside my door to stand guard. I'm going to use my magic to go after Adora myself. You will see that I am not disturbed. Clearly, no one else can be trusted to bring her back to the Horde, least of all you. Now go. I said, go!",1,07
Shadow Weaver," From the farthest reaches of Etheria, I command you, be as one!",1,07
Glimmer, We're here!,1,07
Adora," We're on a cliff, overlooking a thousand foot drop.",1,07
Glimmer," Yes we are, but not for long.",1,07
Glimmer and Bow, Woo-hoo!,1,07
Adora," Uh, guys?",1,07
Bow," C'mon Adora, jump.",1,07
Bow," Oh, ouch. You okay?",1,07
Adora, I'm fine. I thought I saw  I must be stressed.,1,07
Glimmer," Hang in there Adora. Next stop, Mystacor.",1,07
Bow, We rode a flying mountain through clouds. It never gets old.,1,07
Adora," Uh, sure, yea, heh. It was great.",1,07
Glimmer," Just so you know, my aunt Casta can be a lot. But don't worry, I know how to handle her.",1,07
Castaspella, Is that my Glimmer?,1,07
Glimmer," Hi, aunt Casta.",1,07
Castaspella, It's been so long since you've come to visit. And Bow. And who's this?,1,07
Glimmer," This is my friend Adora. She's sometimes and 8 foot tall warrior woman named She-Ra. So, don't get freaked out when it happens.",1,07
Adora, Hi.,1,07
Castaspella," Adora. How nice Glimmer has started making some new friends. We were all so pleased when she started bringing Bow around. I was sure she had made him up at first.  Oh, you've done something to your hair.",1,07
Glimmer," What? Yes, I cut it.",1,07
Castaspella, I can see that. I also see you're not wearing the sweater I knitted for you. Don't you like it?,1,07
Glimmer," Sure, I like it. It's great. It's just... it's a little warm for sweaters right now.",1,07
Castaspella, But you'd tell me if you didn't like it.,1,07
Glimmer," Yes, I'd tell you.",1,07
Bow, I'm wearing the socks you sent me.,1,07
Castaspella," Well, I've always been fond of this one. So, what brings you all the way out here to visit your aunt? Is it once in a blue moon already? ",1,07
Glimmer," We're on a diplomatic mission, Auntie. I'm rebuilding the Princess Alliance and...",1,07
Castaspella," My goodness, you must be starving. I'll have a feast prepared. I'm sure your mother hasn't been feeding you.",1,07
Adora, Wow.,1,07
Castaspella," You've come at the perfect time, there's an eclipse this evening. I'm headed right now to inspect the lunarium for the ceremony. And nothing would make me happier than to give my favorite niece and her friends a tour.",1,07
Glimmer," Uh, Bow and I have had the tour before. And we don't want to get in your way.",1,07
Bow, It's all right Glimmer. Adora hasn't seen it. It'll be fun.,1,07
Castaspella," Oh, well, I guess it's up to Adora then. What do you say my dear?",1,07
Adora," Uh, sure.",1,07
Castaspella," Oh, I like her.",1,07
Adora, Wow.,1,07
Castaspella," The lunar lenses. We use them in the monthly ceremonies to renew Mystacor's magic defenses and keep us shielded from the outside world. You will be coming to the Eclipse Ceremony tonight, won't you?",1,07
Glimmer," Aunt Casta, I've seen the ceremony dozens of times. And we're all really tired from travelling. Maybe we'll skip it this time?",1,07
Castaspella," Nonsense. You're friend Adora hasn't seen it, and it's quite a sight to behold for a newcomer. Besides, don't you want to spend more time with your aunt?",1,07
Glimmer, Of course. But we also really wanted to show Adora the beach.,1,07
Castaspella," Well, if the beach is the only reason you're here, I really shouldn't keep you, should I? I certainly don't want to waste your time.",1,07
Glimmer," Auntie, I didn't mean it that way.",1,07
Bow, Adora.,1,07
Castaspella," Well, someone is enthusiastic. Ah, yes. The hall of sorcerers. These are the Great Ones that led Mystacor through the ages. This is my Micah, my brother. We trained in these very walls together. Glimmer looks just like him you know.",1,07
Glimmer, He had a beard.,1,07
Adora," Wait, Glimmer's dad was your brother?",1,07
Bow," Adora, do you know what aunt means?",1,07
Adora, No. I was just hoping somebody would eventually explain.,1,07
Glimmer," Auntie, we're going to avenge my dad and make sure the Horde never hurts anyone else. Mom believes in us, and in She-Ra.",1,07
Castaspella," Well, if your mother believes, who am I not to? She's an angelic being after all, and I'm just a common sorceress.",1,07
Glimmer," Uhg. Please, not this again.",1,07
Castaspella," She never writes to me you know. I send letters, but do I ever get a reply?",1,07
Adora, What happened to her?,1,07
Castaspella," Light Spinner. A scar on Mystacor's past. She sought power and control above all else, and she was cast out. Although, some say she never really left. That she's only biding her time, waiting to exact her revenge. But those are only children's tales, of course. Anyway, on with the tour. Are you hungry? I've had the dinning room redone since the last time you were here, Glimmer.",1,07
Glimmer, Okay. Aunt Casta's gone to fix us a big dinner and now it's finally beach time.,1,07
Bow, You okay?,1,07
Glimmer," It's worse than we thought. You need warm sand and calming waves, stat.",1,07
Shadow Weaver, It's time for something more.,1,07
Adora," So, we just, like, lie here?",1,07
Glimmer, Absolutely. Letting your cares melt away. Didn't you do something like this to relax in the Horde?,1,07
Adora," Uh, no. We hit things.",1,07
Glimmer," Well, this is so much better. Right Bow?",1,07
Glimmer," Just try it, okay?",1,07
Adora, Okay.,1,07
Adora, Boop.,1,07
Adora, Okay.,1,07
Glimmer," This isn't working for you, is it?",1,07
Adora, No. Can I move now?,1,07
Glimmer," Yes. Clearly we're going to have to take this relaxation thing to the next level. Bow, wake up. ",1,07
Bow, What?,1,07
Glimmer, Come on. We need to show Adora the steam grotto.,1,07
Bow, Whoo! Steam grotto.,1,07
Adora, Wow.,1,07
Bow, Right? Ah. Ooh. Ah.,1,07
Glimmer, These pools are full of magical healing minerals. The sorcerers use them to cleanse themselves of worry and fear before big ceremonies or spells. No just clear your mind. Breathe deeply. Focus on the warmth on your skin. Let your body go perfectly...,1,07
Adora, Ah.,1,07
Shadow Weaver's disembodied voice, Adora.,1,07
Adora," No, no, no, no, no! Help!",1,07
Glimmer, Adora!,1,07
Adora, Shadow Weaver's here. I saw her!,1,07
Bow," Adora, there's no one else here. You brought your sword in here? Are you ok? What happened?",1,07
Adora, Shadow Weaver was here. In the grotto. And she was in in the sorcerers hall too. I saw her shadow on the floor.,1,07
Glimmer, What are you talking about? Who is Shadow Weaver?,1,07
Adora, Shadow Weaver raised me in the Horde. She taught me how to read and tie my boots and how to subvert the enemy and be victorious in battle.,1,07
Glimmer," OK. Sure, mom stuff.",1,07
Adora," No, commanding officer stuff...and mom stuff.",1,07
Glimmer," Adora, she isn't here. She was never here. It's not possible.",1,07
Adora, But you don't know what she's capable of.,1,07
Bow," Sounds like this Shadow Weaver really did a number on you growing up. But you're okay now. You got away from her. Do you wanna try something else? We could get massages, or find you something to hit, if that would work better.",1,07
Adora, No. It's okay. I'm okay. I think I need to be alone. Clear my head.,1,07
Glimmer, You sure?,1,07
Adora, Yea.,1,07
Glimmer, Adora has finally lost it. Did you see her in there? I think she's going nuts.,1,07
Adora," I'm not crazy. I'm, I'm not crazy.",1,07
Adora," You're just a stupid statue. Pull it together Adora, there's no way Shadow Weaver can be here.",1,07
Adora, For the honor of Grayskull!,1,07
Catra's voice," Hey, Adora.",1,07
She-Ra," Catra, where are you? How did you find me here?",1,07
Catra, Nope. Getting colder.,1,07
She-Ra," Whatever you're doing, you won't get away with it. Did Shadow Weaver send you?",1,07
Catra, What do you think? Shadow Weaver controls us both. She always has.,1,07
She-Ra," Catra, wait.",1,07
She-Ra, Catra?,1,07
Hordak," The Horde had high hopes for you, Force Captain. Disappointing. Does the Rebellion truly think you can save them? Nothing can stop the Horde, least of all you.",1,07
She-Ra, Show yourself.,1,07
Hordak," You will lead them all, every Etherian, to their complete and utter annihilation. Nothing will be left of Bright Moon but smoking ruins. Your new friends buried beneath.",1,07
Castaspella, What have you done?,1,07
She-Ra," Uh,sorry. I didn't mean... I thought I just saw...",1,07
Glimmer, Adora!,1,07
Castaspella, Your friend has destroyed a thousand years worth of sacred writings. She could have destroyed the lenses that protect Mystacor.,1,07
Bow, She didn't mean to. Adora would never...,1,07
Castaspella, This is the kind of person you hang around with?,1,07
Glimmer," Auntie, wait.",1,07
Adora, Glimmer.,1,07
Glimmer," It's okay, I'll handle her.",1,07
Bow," The Horde isn't here, Adora. You need to sleep. Promise me you'll try.",1,07
Adora," Okay, I'll try.",1,07
Adora," Glimmer. Look, I'm really sorry about,",1,07
Glimmer," Save it, Adora. How could you do this? I thought you were supposed to be our friend.",1,07
Adora, I am your friend.,1,07
Glimmer, You've ruined everything I've worked for. What kind of friend does that?,1,07
Adora, Glimmer.,1,07
Glimmer, You know what? Maybe you should just go.,1,07
Glimmer, Is Adora coming?,1,07
Bow, I didn't want to wake her up. She needs to sleep.,1,07
Bow," Adora, come on, we have to get out of here now.",1,07
Adora, What's happening.,1,07
Bow, The protection spell is failing. We need to go!,1,07
Adora," Wait, stop. What do you mean failing? Where's Glimmer?",1,07
Bow," Everything that's about to happen is your fault, Adora. You're to blame.",1,07
Shadow Weaver, Adora.,1,07
Adora, Shadow Weaver!,1,07
Shadow Weaver," The eclipse is nearly over Adora. When it is, the shield will be down. The Horde will conquer Mystacor and bring you home to me.",1,07
Adora," No, I'll stop you.",1,07
Shadow Weaver, Why? To help these people? Who are they to you? They don't understand you. Just as they did not understand me when I walked among them as Light Spinner.,1,07
Adora, What?,1,07
Shadow Weaver, They feared my dark power. They'll never accept you. Not like I do.,1,07
Adora," No, no! You're wrong. For the honor of Grayskull!",1,07
Shadow Weaver," You know deep down what I say is true. You are the ambitious, cutthroat, ruthless warrior I raised you to be.",1,07
Adora, No.,1,07
Shadow Weaver, The Princesses don't care about you. They want to use you for your strength. Return now to the Fright Zone. Rule by my side.,1,07
Adora, These are my friends. They've been kind to me. Something you never were.,1,07
Shadow Weaver, I prepared you for greatness!,1,07
Adora," But you never loved me. You just played twisted mind games. I'm none of the things you say I am. I'm not like you. You are bitter and cruel, and you're the one who used me! This is who I am. You hurt my friends, so now you're gonna pay!",1,07
Shadow Weaver, It's too late. The eclipse will be over in moments. Mystacor will fall and it will be your fault.,1,07
Adora, Huh?,1,07
Shadow Weaver," I can give you Etheria. We can rule together. You were nothing before I took you in, Adora. And you will be nothing without me! You're weak!",1,07
Shadow Weaver," Adora, enough of this. Come home.",1,07
Adora, I'm not going back. You have no power over me anymore.,1,07
Shadow Weaver, No!,1,07
Glimmer," Adora, are you okay?",1,07
Adora," I'm okay. Yeah, I think I'm finally okay. She's gone.",1,07
Bow, I'm so sorry we didn't believe you! We've been bad friends.,1,07
Adora," No! You're not. This is what Shadow Weaver does. She manipulates people, she pushes them apart. But it's never going to work on me again. I'm sorry, it's my fault she was here. I endangered Mystacor.",1,07
Castaspella," Nonsense, you saved Mystacor. Glimmer has chosen her friends well. I'll knit you a sweater. What size are you in the shoulders?",1,07
Adora," I'm like, really tired.",1,07
Adora, Glimmer?,1,07
Glimmer," Right here, Adora.",1,07
Catra," Hello? Shadow Weaver?  You've been going about this the wrong way, old woman. If you wanna take down Adora, you have to go for the heart.",1,07
Adora," Uh, hey, guys, I got an invitation to the All Princess Ball, Winter Wonderland. Do you know what this is?",1,08
Bow, Princess Prom! Princess Prom! Princess Prom! We are going to Princess Prom!,1,08
Glimmer, Princess Prom! Princess Prom! Princess Prom! We are going to Princess Prom!,1,08
Adora," Okay, you've gone crazy. I'll just come back later.",1,08
Bow, The ball is a meeting for all the princesses of Etheria.,1,08
Glimmer," And a giant party! Dancing, food, fancy dresses.",1,08
Adora, Dancing?,1,08
Glimmer, It only happens once a decade. I've been waiting years for this!,1,08
Adora," Uh, I'm only a princess sometimes, so are you sure I should even go?",1,08
Glimmer, Of course! Every princess is invited! That includes you!,1,08
Bow, Oh yeah. It's all in the invite.,1,08
Adora, Rules for greeting the hostess. Expected curtsy depth? Proper stair descending etiquette?,1,08
Bow, The ball has been going on for centuries. There's a lot of etiquette stuff you gotta do before you can party.,1,08
Glimmer, It's gonna be so much fun! And Princess Frosta is hosting it this year in the Kingdom of Snows! Her magic is incredibly powerful. She'd be a huge get for The Rebellion!,1,08
Glimmer, Don't worry! I'll be with you and so will Bow 'cause he's going as my plus one!,1,08
Bow, Uh actually--,1,08
Glimmer, It's the best friend squad in action! Right Bow?,1,08
Bow, About that... I'm going with Perfuma.,1,08
Glimmer, What!?,1,08
Catra," I'm sick of this. Shadow Weaver failed to get Adora and if Hordak finds out she'll take us down with her. She's obsessed. We need to think big picture. It's time for someone new to take over. Me. So, you in?",1,08
Scorpia, I'm hanging out in your room! ,1,08
Catra," Unfortunately, you're the only one I can trust around here.",1,08
Scorpia, Because we're best friends.,1,08
Catra," Stop being so you and help me think. I have the beginning of a plan, but it's not enough. I need to capture Adora so Shadow Weaver doesn't demote me. I need to impress Hordak so he'll make me the new Shadow Weaver. How do I do both?",1,08
Scorpia," Why don't you try something at the All-Princess Ball? Every princess is gonna be there, so Adora probably will be too. Ooh! This year's theme is Winter Wonderland.",1,08
Catra, How did you get this?,1,08
Scorpia, They sent it to me. I'm a princess.,1,08
Catra, You're a princess!?,1,08
Scorpia, Yeah. The Horde crash landed in my family's kingdom. We let them stay. My family gave Hordak the Black Garnet.,1,08
Catra, You're a princess?,1,08
Scorpia," I though everyone knew. I mean, it's covered in Force Captain Orientation.",1,08
Catra," I'm beginning to think I shouldn't have skipped that. Okay, so you're a princess, and you're going to a princess ball.",1,08
Scorpia," Oh no. I'm not going. No. No one liked my family, even before we joined The Horde. I never really fit with the other princesses. I made them uncomfortable and they don't like that. They don't like me.",1,08
Catra, And that's exactly why you have to go! How dare they pretend they're better just because you're different! How dare they abandon people just because they don't fit into their perfect little lives!,1,08
Scorpia, Yeah!,1,08
Catra, How dare they take best friends and turn them into giant sword ladies who run off with people clearly inferior to you!,1,08
Scorpia, You're telling my whole life with your words.,1,08
Catra," It's time to show those princesses a thing or two! You're going, I'm coming as your plus one and we'll make this a night no one will ever forget!",1,08
Scorpia, Super Pal Duo is going to prom!,1,08
Bow, I didn't think it would be a big deal.,1,08
Glimmer, It's not. It's fine. I'm just surprised. When did you two even talk about it?,1,08
Bow," Oh, she was super slick.",1,08
Perfuma, Wanna go to the ball with me?,1,08
Bow, Okay!,1,08
Glimmer, That's super slick?,1,08
Bow," I thought it'd be fun. And besides, Perfuma's cool, right?",1,08
Glimmer," She's fine. But we always go to events together. We have our whole routine. We wear matching outfits, share inside jokes and eat ice cream afterwards. It's our thing.",1,08
Bow," Well, there's nothing wrong with a new thing. I gotta get ready. We'll hang out there, okay?",1,08
Glimmer, But I liked our old thing.,1,08
Adora," Glimmer! Good. No time to waste!  I think advance prep will be key to success. I've divided the rules into base parts. Dance rules, etiquette rules, rules for greeting the hostess.  I'm familiarizing myself with targets. Ask me anything.",1,08
Glimmer, Princess Frosta.,1,08
Adora," Ruler of The Kingdom of Snows, has the biggest kingdom outside of Bright Moon, neutral in the fight against the Horde. Allies with the Star Sisters who are friends with Mermista, but no Sweet Bee who is dating Peekablue as you can tell by the string. Up means friends, down means frenemies. And I made an obstacle course! I'm feeling good! I'm prepared for any and all scenarios. I am so ready for this ball.",1,08
Glimmer, Great! What are you wearing?,1,08
Adora," I was just gonna go as She-Ra. I mean, she has better hair.",1,08
Glimmer," Well, you can't go as She-Ra. They have a strict no weapons rule. Neutral ground and all. So, you'll have to leave your sword at the door.",1,08
Adora," Ugh, how are there more parts to this invite?",1,08
Glimmer,  You know what this means?,1,08
Adora, That clothes don't matter and I should keep on studying?,1,08
Glimmer, It's makeover time!!,1,08
Adora, Be careful and don't just lean it somewhere and don't keep it with the other swords or it might get confused!,1,08
Glimmer," Adora, c'mon!",1,08
Adora, Whoa. Heh. It's big.,1,08
Glimmer," The ball is an ancient tradition. A princess' first ball is a huge rite if passage. Plus, the Kingdom of Snows is really big.",1,08
Adora," Which is why we need Frosta. If she joins us, the other princesses are sure to follow.",1,08
Adora,"  Here we go. Hold for one, two and three. That's Frosta? But she's like, 10!",1,08
Frosta, I'm eleven and three quarters.,1,08
Glimmer," Revered hostess, we come under the ancient rules of hospitality, bringing greetings from Bright Moon. And She-Ra, the legendary warrior.",1,08
Frosta, You are welcome under the ancient rules of hospitality. Leave conflict at the door and please enjoy the ball.,1,08
Adora, Thank you your--  majesty. Couldn't have mentioned that she was a little kid?,1,08
Glimmer," You did all that research. I assumed you knew. You know what? It's fine.There's plenty of time to win her over. Come one, let's rock this ball!",1,08
Adora, Oh! There's Entrapta! Heh.,1,08
Entrapta, Adora! Glimmer! Are you here for the social experiment too?,1,08
Adora, Social experiment?,1,08
Entrapta, Different groups are forced to mingle. Hierarchies form and break. It's the perfect place to observe behavior. And they have tiny food! Where's Bow? I wanna show him my new recorder.,1,08
Glimmer, He's coming later.,1,08
Entrapta, Didn't he come with you? Aren't you two friends?,1,08
Glimmer, Why would you think we're not?,1,08
Entrapta, There he is! bow!,1,08
Glimmer, They're matching. That's out best friend thing!,1,08
Entrapta, Feelings seem to be getting hurt.,1,08
Mermista," Hey, I'm here too. Don't make a big thing out of it.",1,08
Glimmer, They're making up their own inside jokes? What? Is Perfuma his new best friend now?,1,08
Mermista, Not gonna get into whatever is happening there.,1,08
Entrapta, People walking around in circles.,1,08
Mermista," Or that. Look, have you seen--",1,08
Sea hawk,"  She's a beauty can't you see? She's attending this with me! She's my princess of the sea! Mermista!  Oh hey, it's my crew.",1,08
Adora," So, Sea Hawk's your plus one?",1,08
Mermista," No. He is just my ride. Just. My. Ride,",1,08
Sea Hawk,  Of course.  I am her plus one.,1,08
Entrapta, This is the best social experiment I've ever been to!,1,08
Mermista, Whatever. Do they have a kelp bar here?,1,08
Sea Hawk," To the buffet! Adventu-- Oh hi, Bow.",1,08
Adora, Hey--,1,08
Glimmer,"  That's so funny, Adora! What a funny inside joke the two of us just came up with!",1,08
Perfuma," The She-Ra, Glimmer. It's great to see you.",1,08
Bow, Perfuma was just telling me about a winged horse that ate all the apples in Plumeria and then flew away. Sound familiar?,1,08
Glimmer," Sure. Isn't this fun? Adora and I are having such a good time together, just the two of us. Right, Adora?",1,08
Bow," Okay. Uh, we're gonna go say hi to people. Wanna come?",1,08
Glimmer," No, you guys go on. We'll find you later. I wanna hear the rest of this funny story that Adora was just telling!",1,08
Adora, Perfect. Frosta's alone. I'm gonna try and go smooth things over with her. Coming?  Never mind. I'll be right back.,1,08
Adora, Revered hostess. I've come to apologize for earlier. I was so rude.,1,08
Frosta," Yes, you were. But as you're only an honorary princess, you can't be expected to know better.",1,08
Adora, Your kingdom is truly beautiful Princess Frosta. I'm honored to be here.,1,08
Frosta," Thank you. Now, I expect you're going to ask me to join your Rebellion?",1,08
Adora, You know about that?,1,08
Frosta, Of course I do. Princesses talk you know? The snow peas and the cookies are touching. Do it right.,1,08
Adora," Princess Frosta, the Rebellion needs you. Your kingdom is powerful. Your alliance could be the key to defeating the Horde.",1,08
Frosta, The Horde hasn't threatened us here.,1,08
Adora," That only because the Kingdom of Snows is so out of the way, it doesn't matter to Hordak right now. Joining the Rebellion is your best bet.",1,08
Frosta, The kingdom of Snows has defended itself perfectly well for thousands of years. We do not need your help or your Rebellion. Please continue to enjoy the ball.,1,08
Bow, Perfuma was just telling about a winged horse that ate all the apples in Plumeria!,1,08
Glimmer, Where have you been?,1,08
Adora," I told you, winning over Frosta. Actually, scratch that, failing to win over Frosta. Are you okay? Why does it bother you so much?",1,08
Glimmer," It doesn't! Bow can hang out with whoever he wants. I just  I never had that many friends. It's always been just me and Bow. But now, what if he likes his new friends better? What if everyone does?",1,08
Adora," That's not gonna happen. Trust me, Bow isn't the type to leave his old friends behind and neither am...",1,08
Adora, ...I.,1,08
Adora," Revered hostess, you can't let them in. They're from the Horde.",1,08
Catra," Revered hostess, Princess Scorpia was invited as per the rules of this ball. Rules which I personally have the upmost respect for.",1,08
Adora, You do not!,1,08
Frosta, Princess Adora. The rules state that all princesses and their chosen guests are welcome.,1,08
Adora, They're up to something. I can feel it.,1,08
Frosta," That's enough! You look at me and see a child, but I have worked to hard to gain respect all to throw it away just because you feel they are up to something. For centuries the All-Princess Ball has been neutral ground. I will not dishonor that legacy. Scorpia is a princess. Princesses get plus ones. They stay.",1,08
Frosta, Teenagers.,1,08
Catra," Really, Adora? I'm shocked. We're not breaking any rules. Didn't you read the invite?",1,08
Adora," I know you're plotting something. From now until the second the ball ends, I'll be watching. Wherever the two of you go, I go.",1,08
Catra, Suit yourself. Have fun with following us!,1,08
Adora,"  Glimmer, you take Scorpia, I'll take Catra.",1,08
Scorpia," Mm. Mm. Wow, that is good. Oh what is-- I don't even know what's in this. What? Sir? Garcon? What's in this?",1,08
Glimmer, Bow! Wait up!,1,08
Bow, Glimmer. Hi.,1,08
Glimmer, There's something I need to tell you. I know things between us have been weird all night. I just wanted to say..,1,08
Bow, I accept your--,1,08
Glimmer, I forgive you.,1,08
Bow," You forgive me? Glimmer, I'm allowed to hang out with other people.",1,08
Glimmer," B-b-but that's how it starts. Suddenly everyone has new friends and no one needs me anymore. And then, I'm all alone.",1,08
Bow," What are you talking about? you have me, plus Adora and everyone ho joined the Rebellion.",1,08
Glimmer," That's what i'm talking about. It used to be just us. And now, everything's changing. I don't want you to leave me behind.",1,08
Bow," No one is leaving you behind. I wanted to hang out with you and Adora and Perfuma tonight. But you're the one who keeps acting weird and leaving. I know change is scary, Glimmer. But that doesn't mean you get to take it out on me. Now, if you'll excuse me, I am going to go get my cummerbund because it is freezing in here! We'll talk later, okay?",1,08
Entrapta," Princess Prom, hour two... 37 minutes...",1,08
Adora, Don't touch her!,1,08
Entrapta,  You're right. This is a much better vantage point for my observations. Hi Adora. Have you met my new assistant? She brought snacks.,1,08
Catra, She stole my food then asked me to spy on people with her. Is this what love feels like?,1,08
Adora," Entrapta, she's from the Horde. The people the Rebellion are fighting. The Rebellion you're a part of!",1,08
Entrapta," Oh. Well, we should keep a better eye on her 'cause she just walked away.",1,08
Adora, ,1,08
Bow, Is that a--  Oh no! Princess Scorpia is planting heat bombs! We have to stop her!,1,08
Bow, What are you doing? Let me go!,1,08
Frosta," It is my duty as hostess to now announce, it is time for the first dance of the Ball.",1,08
Catra," I don't know about you, but I am having a blast.",1,08
Adora," Whatever you're planning, it won't work.",1,08
Catra, You sure?,1,08
Glimmer,  I got into a fight with Bow and I don't know where Scorpia is!,1,08
Adora, What? Glimmer don't--,1,08
Perfuma," Have you seen Bow? He went to get his cummerbund, right around when that Horde princess left.",1,08
Adora, Do you mean Scorpia?,1,08
Adora," Glimmer, when did you last see Bow?",1,08
Glimmer, A while ago. Isn't he with Perfuma?,1,08
Adora, No. Perfuma says he's been gone this entire time.,1,08
Catra," Maybe my plan won't work. But then again, maybe it already has. Say, where's your friend, Bow?",1,08
Adora,  What did you do to him!?,1,08
Catra,  Nothing permanent.,1,08
Adora," Tell me what you did!  Revered hostess, she's got--",1,08
Frosta, Princess Ball is a ceremony of unity. Violence is strictly forbidden.,1,08
Adora, You don't understand.,1,08
Frosta," I understand perfectly. In accordance with the rules set over the centuries, I hereby revoke your invitation. You are to leave my kingdom and never, ever--",1,08
Frosta, Remain calm! Stop!,1,08
Adora, Glimmer! Catra has Bow. You have to find him! Catra. What did you do?,1,08
Catra," I did nothing. Scorpia, Lonnie and Kyle on the other hand were very busy. It was fun distracting you though.",1,08
Adora, This isn't a game!,1,08
Catra," It's never been a game to me. I'm after something bigger, and no one is gonna stop me.",1,08
Glimmer, Bow? Bow! Where are you?  Get away from him! No!  ,1,08
Adora, Ha. Trapped.,1,08
Catra, You wish.,1,08
Adora, Hang on! I can get us out of this!,1,08
Catra," Oh, Adora. I don't want you to.",1,08
Adora,  Catra! ,1,08
Catra,"  See you later, princess.",1,08
Catra," Check this thing out. You've got to admit, Shadow Weaver, in a single mission, I inflicted more damage on the Rebellion than anyone else. I succeeded where even you failed.",1,09
Hordak, Shadow Weaver.,1,09
Shadow Weaver, My Lord.,1,09
Hordak, I commend you on the capture of the Princess of Bright Moon. Queen Angella has been given until the mornings moonrise to surrender herself to our forces.,1,09
Shadow Weaver," Thank-you, Lord Hordak. I thought you would be please with my work.",1,09
Hordak, You have proven your worth to me. Today.,1,09
Catra, Your worth? I'm the one who brought back the Princess of Bright Moon. Not you.,1,09
Shadow Weaver," You're under my command, Force Captain. Therefore anything you manage to do right is credited to me.",1,09
Catra," So, I do all the work and you get the glory?",1,09
Shadow Weaver, Sometimes that just the way of things.,1,09
Shadow Weaver," Welcome to the Fright Zone, Princess.",1,09
Adora, Your Majesty?,1,09
Queen Angella," I should never have let her leave this castle. And now, I'm faced with an impossible position. As leader of the Rebellion, how can I surrender myself to our enemy? And yet, as a mother, how do I...  I'm going to accept Hordak's terms. Glimmer is all I have.",1,09
Adora, You can't. We have no guarantee the Horde will hold up their end of the bargain. We could end up losing you too.,1,09
Queen Angella," A rescue attempt is too risky. If we had She-Ra we might have a chance, but without the Sword of Protection...",1,09
Adora, There has to be another way. We can't just give up. I can rescue them. I know the Fright Zone. I'll find a way to get them back.,1,09
Queen Angella, How are you going to do that?,1,09
Adora," I... I don't know yet. But I'll think of something, I promise. I'll bring them home. ",1,09
Adora, Huh? What are you all doing here?,1,09
Mermista, We're the Princess Alliance. And the Horde took one of our own.,1,09
Perfuma, We're ready for our first mission.,1,09
Adora, Let's go get our friends back.,1,09
Kyle," Dinner rations, prisoner.",1,09
Kyle, Ow!,1,09
Bow," Hey, what's your name?",1,09
Kyle, Me? You're talking to me?,1,09
Bow, Sure. Is that all right?,1,09
Kyle," Uh, I guess, but no one ever talks to me. I'm Kyle.",1,09
Bow," Hey, Kyle, I'm Bow. Can you do me a favor? Can you tell me where they're holding the princess?",1,09
Kyle, Princess?,1,09
Bow, She's my best friend. No one will let me talk to her or even tell me if she's okay.,1,09
Kyle, I'm sure she's fine. Maybe. Or she's not. I don't know.,1,09
Bow, Do you know where she is?,1,09
Kyle," No, that kind of information is classified. They wouldn't tell me.",1,09
Bow, You have to help me get a message to her.,1,09
Kyle," I, uh. I better be leaving now.",1,09
Bow," No, wait.",1,09
Kyle, I like your shirt!,1,09
Bow, Kyle!,1,09
Adora," Okay. This is the Horde prison. Glimmer and Bow are being held inside. Entrpata, this perfume bottle is you. Perfuma, you're the nail polish. Mermista, lipstick.",1,09
Mermista, Ew. Do you know what that stuff is made of? I'll be this knife.,1,09
Entrapta, I feel like Perfuma should be the perfume bottle. That makes the most logical sense.,1,09
Perfuma, Maybe I could be a flower.,1,09
Sea Hawk, Could I be this miniature painted model of Bow?,1,09
Adora," No! Those represent Bow and Glimmer. And this one's mine. Bow made them for us. Okay, just... Everyone focus! Our entry point will be here, near the Horde's scrapyard. It's close to the prison and lightly guarded. Perfuma and Entrapta will access the security tower and wait for my signal to disable the lights. Mermista will access the Fright Zone's sewer system. She'll swim through the pipes into the building and open the door.",1,09
Mermista," I'm sorry, Mermista will what?",1,09
Adora," I know it sounds bad, but your'e the only one who can breathe underwater.",1,09
Mermista, Super gross.,1,09
Adora, Sea Hawk and I will take up position by the entrance. The two of us will neutralize any guards on patrol. Entrpata and Perfuma will regroup on our position and the team will enter when Mermista opens the door.,1,09
Sea Hawk, Excellent plan. Adventure!,1,09
Mermista, Hm?,1,09
Adora, Mermista should be in place now.,1,09
Perfuma, Adora's signal.,1,09
Entrapta," Fright Zone log, day one. I can barely contain my excitement! Hahaha. Hmm, the Horde's using an outdated wiring system. It really would work so much better if I just consolidated these conduits and re-routed the current here...",1,09
Perfuma, Entrapta? Now would be a good time for those lights.,1,09
Entrapta," Oh, right.",1,09
Horde guard, What happened?,1,09
Adora, We go on three. Ready? One...,1,09
Sea Hawk, Forward!,1,09
Adora, I said on three.,1,09
Sea Hawk, I got excited.,1,09
Sea Hawk, Where's Mermista?,1,09
Adora," She must've gotten held up. Come on, we need to secure the guards.",1,09
Perfuma, Entrapta? Entrapta?,1,09
Entrapta," The subject appears to be harvesting scrap components, possibly for reuse. Fascinating.",1,09
Perfuma, Entrapta? We're supposed to meet with the others.,1,09
Entrapta," I know, I was waiting for you.",1,09
Perfuma," Oh, how very considerate. Lets go.",1,09
Entrapta," Ah, oh.",1,09
Perfuma, So we don't get separated.,1,09
Adora, Psst.,1,09
Scorpia, Halt! Who are you?,1,09
Sea Hawk, Me? I'm the inspector. I'm here to inspect all the things.,1,09
Scorpia," Inspector? Inspector, of course! I must have forgotten you were coming. We're long overdue for an inspection, I do have to admit it, but I can assure you we are up to code.",1,09
Adora, Wha...? How did this happen? We had a plan.,1,09
Entrapta, Actually you kind of lost me at the perfume bottle.,1,09
Adora, Where have you two been?,1,09
Perfuma, I tried to get here sooner but harmonious teamwork with Entrapta can be...a challenge.,1,09
Adora, This isn't a game. It's the Horde. Glimmer and Bow are being held captive in this building and now Sea Hawk is gone.,1,09
Perfuma," Okay. All right, everyone calm down. Maybe we could try a simple breathing exercise. Deep calming breaths, hmmmm.",1,09
Adora," Come on, we're going in.",1,09
Mermista, Could you not?,1,09
Adora, Huh? What happened to you?,1,09
Mermista," Uh, the sewer happened to me.",1,09
Adora, We can't waste any more time. Bow and Glimmer need us.,1,09
Mermista," Uh, can I get a thank-you?",1,09
Adora, Thank-you.,1,09
Adora, We need to get to an information port. I'll hack into the data base and identify the cell block Glimmer and Bow are being held in.,1,09
Mermista," Hey, where's the geeky princess?",1,09
Perfuma," Okay, she is really putting a crimp in my harmony!",1,09
Adora, Don't worry. We'll find Entrapta and Sea Hawk and we'll rescue Glimmer and Bow.,1,09
Mermista," I don't know, that sounds like a lot. But you know me, I'm totally up for anything.",1,09
Entrapta," Fright Zone log, day one continued. Keypads appear in every corridor and are capable of giving status updates on multiple systems.",1,09
Entrapta, Wow. Hello there little guy.,1,09
Entrapta," Well, hello to you too. ",1,09
Shadow Weaver," I should warn you Princess. Any attempt to teleport through these restraints will only cause you pain. It seems my Black Garnet and your powers don't mix. Besides, your mother will be here soon.",1,09
Glimmer," I know all about you and your mind games, Shadow Weaver. Adora told me, so save it! And, by the way, she's not a fan.",1,09
Shadow Weaver," But I'm not playing games. What I said about Queen Angella is true. She's coming to surrender herself in exchange for your safety. Oh, it's such a shame, the toll this rebellion has taken on your family. First you lose your father...",1,09
Glimmer, She-Ra will stop you!,1,09
Shadow Weaver, There is no She-Ra! We have the sword. Not Adora. There will be no one left to stop the Horde. In a few hours Bright Moon will fall and Etheria will be ours to rule.,1,09
Shadow Weaver," Oh, tsk-tsk. Careful now. It would be a shame if we had no princess to exchange for the Queen.",1,09
Sea Hawk," Well, you Horde types run a tight ship, I must say. Everything seems up to code. Yes indeed, entirely up to code. You pass with flying colors. Now, unless you have something else for me to inspect, I should get home to my inspector children.",1,09
Scorpia," You know, you look familiar.",1,09
Sea Hawk," Perhaps you've seen me, in your dreams?",1,09
Scorpia," No, that's not it. Princess Prom. That's where I know you from. I knew it would come to me. You were with that mermaid.",1,09
Sea Hawk," She has a name you know! I mean, no, that wasn't me.",1,09
Scorpia, You're with the Rebellion.,1,09
Sea Hawk," Now, as a scrupulous inspector, threats  normally wouldn't work on me. But in this case, uh, perhaps we can reach a compromise?  ""Duck?""",1,09
Scorpia," Oh, where?",1,09
Sea Hawk, Oh! Duck!,1,09
Entrapta, Hi.,1,09
Sea Hawk, Oh! That was a top-notch rescue.,1,09
Entrapta, To be honest I wasn't sure which one of you I was gonna hit.,1,09
Adora," Okay, I found Bow's cell, but I can't find Glimmer in here anywhere. They must be holding her somewhere else. This isn't good. ",1,09
Perfuma, What should we do?,1,09
Mermista, I'm not going back in the sewer.,1,09
Entrapta," It's okay. This is my new friend, Emily. I reprogrammed her.",1,09
Perfuma, Where have you been?,1,09
Entrapta, Where have you been?,1,09
Adora, It doesn't matter. We're all together. Let's finish this.,1,09
Adora," Bow's cell is in section B, level 20. We'll get him out first then figure out where Glimmer is. Entrapta, can you get us up there?",1,09
Entrapta," Yes! I can. I mean, maybe. I don't know. I'm definitely gonna try.  This is gonna be fun!",1,09
Adora," Okay, Sea Hawk, Perfuma you're with me.",1,09
Mermista," I'll keep an eye on this one, in case she tries to befriend any more robots.",1,09
Sea Hawk, On to the rescue!,1,09
Kyle, Bow. Bow!,1,09
Bow, Kyle?,1,09
Kyle, I'm supposed to be in the barracks. Lonnie made me cover her latrine duty.,1,09
Bow, What's going on?,1,09
Kyle, I found out where your friend is being kept. Shadow Weaver has her in the Black Garnet chamber.,1,09
Bow," Oh, that sounds bad.",1,09
Kyle," Yeah, it's pretty bad. But she's alive, at least. Shadow Weaver is planning to ransom her in exchange for Queen.",1,09
Bow, Why are you telling me this?,1,09
Kyle," I don't know. I guess, because your the first person who's ever listened to me.",1,09
Bow," I mean, I'm being held prisoner, so... I don't know that I have a choice, but sure!",1,09
Entrapta, Whoops. That's not right.,1,09
Adora, Entrapta!,1,09
Sea Hawk, Perfuma! Hmm? ,1,09
Adora, Hang on!,1,09
Lonnie, You think you can just come back here?,1,09
Adora, I need to save my friends.,1,09
Lonnie, We were your friends.,1,09
Sea Hawk, Huh?,1,09
Perfuma," Adora, are you all right?",1,09
Adora, Thanks to you.,1,09
Sea Hawk, Great hit Perfuma.,1,09
Kyle," No one's ever, ever asked for my help before. People here don't think I can do anything right.",1,09
Bow, Um-hm. That seems tough.,1,09
Kyle, Why am I telling you this? I shouldn't even be here. I'm going to get into so much trouble if I get caught.,1,09
Bow," No! Wait, I mean  we're just talking. How much trouble could you get in for talking?",1,09
Kyle," Oh, you'd be surprised. I get in trouble for everything around here.",1,09
Bow, That doesn't seem fair.,1,09
Kyle," I know! But then I thought how brave you are for wanting to save your friend. And maybe, if I helped you, you could be my friend too.",1,09
Bow," Uh, sure, friends, definitely. We can be friends. ",1,09
Entrapta," Good team, geek princess.",1,09
Sea Hawk, Goodbye!,1,09
Sea Hawk, Bow!  We're here to save you.,1,09
Bow, Adora!,1,09
Adora," Bow! Bow, where's Glimmer?",1,09
Bow," Shadow Weaver has her in the Black Garnet chamber. Adora, what are we gonna do?",1,09
Adora, Come on.,1,09
Adora, Can you get it open?,1,09
Entrapta, I just need a little more time.,1,09
Adora," This vent system leads to where you can steal a skiff. Each chamber needs to be sealed and purged before you can move on to the next one. The doors will only stay open for a few seconds, so keep up the pace.",1,09
Bow," Adora, what are you doing?",1,09
Adora," Don't worry about me. I'm gonna buy you some time and find Glimmer. Meet you there, okay?",1,09
Bow, Adora!,1,09
Adora," I surrender, take me to see Shadow Weaver.",1,09
Adora," Glimmer, I'm here. Don't worry everything will be okay. I'll save you. What have you done to her?",1,09
Shadow Weaver," Leave us. Report to the Force Captain barracks and pack your things. Now that Adora is back, there's no need for you there.",1,09
Catra," Seriously? After everything I've done for you, it's still her you want?",1,09
Shadow Weaver, I said go!,1,09
Adora," Shadow Weaver, I'll stay here with you willingly, but you have to let Glimmer go first.",1,09
Glimmer," Adora, no.",1,09
Adora," Glimmer, are you okay?",1,09
Shadow Weaver," You are correct Adora. You shall stay willingly, because I am going to wipe your mind. You'll have no memory of She-Ra or the time you spent with the Rebellion. Everything will be as it once was. As for the Princess, once I'm done, you'll be happy to have her as your prisoner.",1,09
Glimmer, No! Adora!,1,09
Bow, We need to go back for Glimmer and Adora.,1,09
Perfuma, We need to do what Adora said. They'll make it out and we'll be ready with the skiff. No princess will be left behind.,1,09
Glimmer," Adora, are you okay? Do you know who I am?",1,09
Adora, Glimmer.,1,09
Sea Hawk, We made it. This way to the vehicle bay.,1,09
Entrapta, Wait. Emily.,1,09
Perfuma, Entrapta! No!,1,09
Adora," Glimmer, what's happening?",1,09
Glimmer, I don't know. I can't teleport.,1,09
Adora, What?,1,09
Adora, Catra. What are you doing?,1,09
Catra, Take it. This is not because I like you.,1,09
Adora," Catra, I...",1,09
Catra, Just get out of here.,1,09
Adora, For the honor of Grayskull!,1,09
Bow, There they are.,1,09
Bow, Glimmer.,1,09
She-Ra," Wait, where's Entrapta?",1,09
Bow, Entrapta didn't make it.,1,09
She-Ra, What do you mean?,1,09
Mermista, She's gone.,1,09
She-Ra," Well, then, we have to go back for her.",1,09
Bow," No, she's... She's really gone.",1,09
Adora, How could I let this happen?,1,10
Bow," Adora, it’s not your fault.",1,10
Adora, It IS my fault. Entrapta’s gone because of my plan.,1,10
Mermista, This only happened because we were all together.,1,10
Perfuma," Mermista’s right, being together makes us vulnerable.",1,10
Mermista, Maybe there’s a reason the Princess Alliance fell apart before. Maybe this whole thing was a bad idea.,1,10
Glimmer," Mermista, no, you can’t say that.",1,10
Mermista," Whatever. I don’t want to be a part of it anymore. Sea Hawk, take me home.",1,10
Angella," Oh, Glimmer! ",1,10
Angella, Are you hurt? ,1,10
Glimmer," Mom, you’re crushing me.",1,10
Glimmer," Mom, I’m fine, cut it out!",1,10
Angella, I will not cut it out. I’ve been beside myself with worry. You usually teleport out of my embraces. What’s going on?,1,10
Glimmer," Nothing, I just need to recharge. That’s all.",1,10
Angella," Of course, Guards, carry my daughter to the Moonstone Chamber at once.",1,10
Glimmer," I don’t need to be carried, I can walk.  You’re embarrassing me.",1,10
Angella, Fine. Then you have time to tell me what happened. I received word of Entrapta’s loss.,1,10
Angella," Well, Glimmer? Bow? Adora? Someone tell me what happened.",1,10
Adora," -Commander, it’s my fault.",1,10
Bow, -The thing is...,1,10
Glimmer, -Leave my friends alone! Give us a minute.,1,10
Angella, A minute? You were being held by the Horde. I’ve been going mad. Telling myself awful stories about what could’ve happened to you.,1,10
Glimmer," Jeeze, mom, relax. I’m fine. We’ll talk later.",1,10
Angella, This conversation isn’t over!,1,10
Adora, I’m— I’m sorry.,1,10
Adora, It’s happening more often.,1,10
Bow, Does it hurt?,1,10
Glimmer," No, not much.",1,10
Bow, We need to tell your mom. She’ll know what to do.,1,10
Glimmer, No!,1,10
Adora," Glimmer, Shadow Weaver did something to your powers. You can’t teleport and, whatever this is, keeps happening.",1,10
Glimmer," I don’t want my mom freaking out anymore than she already is. Okay? Besides, I always feel better after I recharge, so...",1,10
Glimmer," Then it’s agreed. I’ll recharge, stop glitching. Then my mom never has to know.",1,10
Hordak," Not only did you lose the princess known as Glimmer, but I’ve learned that you’ve known Adora was She-Ra all along.",1,10
Shadow Weaver, Now you see why I felt it was so important to bring her back.,1,10
Hordak," All you did was invite attack from an enemy combatant with detailed knowledge of our operations. If I had known, I never would have agreed to your foolish plan.",1,10
Catra,"  Yeah, bad plan.",1,10
Scorpia, Wasn’t it your—?  Oh!,1,10
Glimmer, I can feel you watching me.,1,10
Bow, I am not.,1,10
Glimmer," See, I told you. Just needed to re—  ",1,10
Glimmer, It didn’t work.,1,10
Bow, Work? It made it worse.,1,10
Angella, Glimmer? Are you up there?,1,10
Adora," Uh, guys? We have a problem.",1,10
Glimmer, We cannot let my mom see me like this!,1,10
Angella," There you are, Glimmer. Are you feeling better?",1,10
Glimmer,"  Whoa, Mom, can’t a girl recharge in private? Anyway, we were just leaving. Bye!",1,10
Angella," Is everything all right? Glimmer? Glimmer, do not walk away from me. I just wanted to talk.",1,10
Catra," Boy, Hordak really let Shadow Weaver have it. Did you see the look on her face?",1,10
Scorpia," Yes.  Well, I mean, I think. It’s kinda hard to tell with the mask and all.",1,10
Catra," Serves her right. If she wants to take credit for my plans, she can take the blame, too.",1,10
Scorpia, -Oh! What is it?,1,10
Catra, Shh.,1,10
Scorpia," Oh, sorry. What is it?",1,10
Scorpia," Yeah. Yeah, that’s— That’s concrete.",1,10
Entrapta, Hi,1,10
Glimmer, Maybe it’s like a cold. I’ve never been sick before. Having an immortal mother has some advantages. What do you do when you have a cold?,1,10
Adora, Remain out of sight.,1,10
Adora," What? Display of physical weakness are strongly discouraged in the Horde. And they’re right. I haven’t been training enough, and look what happened! ",1,10
Bow," Stop it, Adora. They’re not right. Okay, cold. Um... Lots of liquids and, uh, rest.  I’ll make soup!",1,10
Glimmer," Great, and I’ll nap. I bet when I wake up I’ll be as good as new. Yeah, just gotta let it run its course.",1,10
Glimmer,  Why did I make my bed so high? Give me a boost?,1,10
Adora,  We’re not letting anything run its course. You’re getting worse.,1,10
Glimmer," No, I’m not.  ",1,10
Glimmer," Okay, maybe a little.",1,10
Adora," Look, you got sick because of whatever dark magic Shadow Weaver made with the black garnet. Maybe the sword can heal you. She-Ra healed the trees in Plumeria.",1,10
Bow," Uh... Sort of, not really.",1,10
Adora," Well, She-Ra definitely fixed the Sea Gate.",1,10
Bow, Glimmer’s not a piece of machinery. And you don’t know how to fully control She-Ra’s powers yet. No offense.,1,10
Glimmer," This is a great idea. She-Ra will fix me, and then everything will be back to normal. Mm-hmm. How hard can it be?",1,10
Bow, Did no one hear what I just..?,1,10
Adora, For the honor of Grayskull!,1,10
Catra, Prisoner.,1,10
Scorpia, That’s Entrapta.,1,10
Catra," I know her name, I was just.. Ugh, never mind. Lord Hordak himself tasked me with your interrogation. So, there’s no use resisting.",1,10
Catra, I don’t care what it takes. I’m going to drag the Rebellion’s plans out of you.,1,10
Entrapta, -Ooh! What’s that?,1,10
Catra, What? Hey!,1,10
Scorpia," Catra! Oh! Oh, oh, there you go.",1,10
Entrapta, Fascinating.,1,10
Catra, Give it back!,1,10
Entrapta," -Oh, I like that thing. Can I have it?",1,10
Catra, -No. And stop. I’m interrogating you.,1,10
Entrapta," Well, okay, then. What do you want to know?",1,10
Catra, Why were you hiding out in the Fright Zone?,1,10
Entrapta," I was waiting for my friends to get back. They had trouble finding me before. So, I figured I’d make it easier for them and just stay put right here.",1,10
Catra, They left you.,1,10
Entrapta," No, no, they’re my friends, they’ll be back.",1,10
Entrapta," Say, your tail secretes some kind of paralyzing agent, right? Do you think I could have a sample, to study?",1,10
Scorpia," Hey, you can’t just touch another woman’s tail without asking!",1,10
Catra," Some friends. They left you, and they’re not coming back. Isn’t that just like Adora? She left me behind, too. Like I was nothing.",1,10
Scorpia," And me. I mean, I didn’t want to go, but she could’ve at least asked.",1,10
Catra," Adora got her precious Bow and Glimmer back. All these princesses care about is people who are just like them. But you’re not like them, are you?",1,10
Entrapta," Fright Zone log, hour 45. Is that right? I don’t know if that’s right, it was hard to tell in the walls. Hour 45, that’s— That’s too many hours. This angry feline person seems to be correct. They’re not coming back for me.",1,10
Catra," You wouldn’t have to pretend to be something you’re not with the Horde. Think of what you could accomplish here. What we could accomplish, together.",1,10
Entrapta, I’ve made more progress on my work in secret here than I did in a whole non-secret life out there. They should see. Horde technology gives me SO MUCH to work with. Emily’s the most advanced bot I’ve ever built.,1,10
Catra," Wait, who’s Emily?",1,10
Entrapta," Oh! How rude, allow me to introduce you. ",1,10
Scorpia," I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha!",1,10
Catra, Those princesses have no idea who they’ve left behind.,1,10
She-Ra, The.. Eternia.. Heal!  Heal.. Glimmer.,1,10
Bow," Who’s ready to stop messing around with sharp objects? Hey, look, I am!",1,10
Glimmer, Maybe if you point it at me?,1,10
Bow," Or, unpopular opinion, don’t point a sword directly at our friend.",1,10
She-Ra," It’s fine, I got this.",1,10
Glimmer, Maybe it’s like a motion? Like a jabbing motion? Or a strike.,1,10
Bow, Do you want to get hit with a sword?!,1,10
She-Ra, Can everyone please be quiet? I have it!,1,10
Bow, Am I the only one who cares about sword safety around here?,1,10
She-Ra,  I think it’s working.,1,10
Glimmer," Yup, definitely working. I’m pretty sure I feel something.",1,10
Bow, Sword safety!,1,10
Scorpia," Honestly, I don’t think anybody’s gonna notice.",1,10
Entrapta, Sorry again. About the wall.,1,10
Catra, -Don’t worry about it.,1,10
Entrapta, -You’re not mad? People usually get mad.,1,10
Catra," Are you kidding? I’m impressed. You rebuilt that robot, I mean, Emily, all on your own? While living in the vents?",1,10
Entrapta," Sure did. Not only that, but she’s better than ever. Stronger, increased weapons capabilities, and affectionate, too.",1,10
Entrapta," Who knows how much more powerful she could be if I just had access to a little First Ones tech. You don’t have any here, do you?",1,10
Catra, -First what?,1,10
Entrapta," -First Ones tech. You know, advanced technology left behind by a lost civilization? Makes our modern innovations look like children’s toys? I’ve been attempting to integrate First Ones tech into my experiments for years, but my understanding of their code is still rudimentary. If I could just find the key to their language, there’s no telling what I could build. Such a find could yield almost unlimited power. ",1,10
Catra, And where would one find this tech?,1,10
Entrapta," It’s buried all over the planet. It gives off a signal that can be traced. Lately, I’ve been tracking the strongest signal I’ve ever seen. It must be a massive stash.",1,10
"Catra, with sparkling eyes", -Where?,1,10
Scorpia, -Ugh.,1,10
Scorpia, Huh. ,1,10
Catra," I mean, uh, where?",1,10
Entrapta," I’ve triangulated the signal to somewhere in the Whispering Woods. The whole shifting landscape thing makes for a complicated variable, but I’ve created a map that’s accurate within two quadrants.",1,10
Catra, How do I get my hands on this map?,1,10
Entrapta," Like any good scientist, I carry everything I need on my person.",1,10
Catra," I’m not sure if we can trust her yet. But if she’s telling the truth, this could give us a huge advantage over the Rebellion. Hordak will finally see how much more valuable I am than Shadow Weaver.",1,10
Scorpia, I bet he’ll promote you to.. To.. What comes after Force Captain?,1,10
Catra, Keep an eye on Entrapta while I go see if this pans out.,1,10
Entrapta," I hope it does, I wanna build something bbbiiigggg.",1,10
Entrapta," Oh, sorry, my bad.",1,10
Entrapta, Which hair part was in which thingy?,1,10
She-Ra, What good am I if I can’t even heal one princess?,1,10
She-Ra,  Why even carry a sword?,1,10
Glimmer," Everybody, just act normal.",1,10
Glimmer," Mom, we’re busy.",1,10
Angella, I won’t be long. You are requested for dinner with me tonight. Alone.,1,10
Glimmer, But Mom! I’m really tired. Can’t I just stay in my room and rest?,1,10
Angella," I’m sorry, I don’t know why I said request. It’s not a request. You are required to have dinner with me because I’m your mother and.. I’m also the queen, so I can make you.",1,10
Bow, Yikes. She’s playing the queen card.,1,10
Angella, No need to answer. I’ll see you in an hour.,1,10
She-Ra, That’s it. I can’t stay here and be useless. Bow is right. I don’t know how to use my powers.,1,10
Bow, I didn’t say that. Or not that exactly.,1,10
She-Ra," The Horde has a lot of things wrong. Okay, pretty much everything. But one thing they are right about is training. And how can I train if I don’t know anything about She-Ra? I’m going to go somewhere so I can learn. And then I’m gonna fix you, Glimmer.",1,10
Glimmer,  How? Can you do it in an hour?,1,10
She-Ra," Probably not, since I’m not totally sure where I’m going. I need to find the place Madame Razz took me. I- it’s some sort of beacon. I can’t explain it, but I-I know I can get answers there.",1,10
Glimmer, Running away. Great idea. Then I won’t have to go to dinner with my mom. I’ll get my things.,1,10
She-Ra," No, I have to do this on my own.",1,10
Adora,  Ow.,1,10
Bow, She’s okay.,1,10
Glimmer, I hope she stays that way.,1,10
Shadow Weaver, Going somewhere?,1,10
Catra," Like I’d tell you. I’ve got a lead on something big, and I’m not about to let you take all the credit again. Not that it worked out so great for you last time.",1,10
Catra," Don’t worry about that thing with Hordak. I’ve got loads of experience being yelled at. Mostly by you, actually. You get used to it.",1,10
Shadow Weaver, I will not get used to mediocrity like you. And I certainly don’t need your pity.,1,10
Adora,"  Hello?  I carry the sword of She-Ra, and I've come here for help. Is anyone there?",1,11
Hologram," Greetings,  administrator. What is your query?",1,11
Adora," Oh. I need your help to heal my friend. She's been cursed, and I-I don't know how to save her. The legends say that She-Ra could heal people using this sword. How do I do that?",1,11
Hologram, What is your query?,1,11
Adora, Not this again.  ...For the honor of Grayskull!,1,11
She-Ra, How about now?,1,11
Hologram," Administrator detected. Welcome, She-Ra.",1,11
She-Ra, One more time. What can you tell me about this sword?,1,11
She-Ra, How can I use the sword to heal my friend?,1,11
Hologram, Query not recognized.,1,11
She-Ra,  The legends say the sword has healing powers. Is that true?,1,11
Hologram, One of the Sword of Protection's many intended functions is to heal and restore balance.,1,11
She-Ra,  But how do I do that?,1,11
Hologram, Query not recognized.,1,11
She-Ra,  How can I use the sword to heal people?! ,1,11
Hologram, One of the Sword of Protection's  many intended functions is to heal and restore balance.,1,11
She-Ra,  Okay. Is there someone else I can talk to?,1,11
Hologram, Query not recognized.,1,11
She-Ra, Okay. Has visions from when she first found the sword]  Let me talk to Light Hope.,1,11
Hologram,  Light Hope.,1,11
She-Ra, Light Hope. That's her name isn't it? The woman I saw when I touched the sword for the first time? Where is she?,1,11
Hologram," Yes, Light Hope is here. She has been waiting for you.",1,11
She-Ra, Can I talk to her?,1,11
Hologram," You will meet her soon enough. But first, you must let go.",1,11
She-Ra, What's that supposed to mean?,1,11
Hologram, You are not ready yet. You must let go.,1,11
She-Ra, Let go of what?,1,11
Catra,  Hey! Watch it!,1,11
She-Ra, Catra? What are you doing here?,1,11
Hologram,  Unauthorized presence detected. Security protocol activated.,1,11
She-Ra," No, no, no, not again!",1,11
Catra, What just happened?,1,11
She-Ra, This isn't good. You're not supposed to be in here.,1,11
Catra,  What are those?,1,11
She-Ra, Also not good!,1,11
She-Ra, Come on! We need to run!,1,11
Catra, What's going on? Why are those things trying to kill us?,1,11
She-Ra, They're trying to kill you. This place sees you as an invader.,1,11
Catra," Well, can't you tell them to stop?",1,11
She-Ra,"  No, I can't tell them to stop! Clearly nothing in here is listening to me!",1,11
Catra,  --Adora?,1,11
She-Ra, Stand back!,1,11
Catra,  What are you doing?!,1,11
Adora," You shouldn't be here, Catra. Those things aren't going to stop until they get you, and as long as I'm protecting you, they'll see me as a threat, too.",1,11
Catra,"  Uh, good thing I didn't ask you to protect me.",1,11
Adora,"  Wait, you know, what-- Okay. Why are you here, anyway? I mean, how did you even find this place?",1,11
Catra,  It sent up a beam of light a mile high. It wasn't hard.,1,11
Adora,  ...Does Shadow Weaver know you're here?,1,11
Catra,"  I'd say Shadow Weaver's got bigger problems right now.  Why are you looking at me like that? Wait. Nooo... I know what this is about.  Ugh, I knew you'd be weird about me letting you escape. I told you it's not because I like you.",1,11
Adora," I mean, I didn't--I didn't say anything.",1,11
Catra," Anyway, what are you doing here?  Where are your new best friends? I thought you guys did everything together.",1,11
Adora,"  Oh, my friends? You mean the ones you kidnapped and held for ransom? The ones you let Shadow Weaver imprison and curse?",1,11
Catra,"  Yeah, obviously. What other friends would I be talking about?",1,11
Adora," ...Come on. Those things will be back any minute, we need to get out of here.",1,11
Catra," Well, we don't need to go together. You do your weird little magic quest thing, I'll find my own way out.",1,11
Catra,  Another dead end.,1,11
Adora," No, it's not.  Eternia.  Eh, long story.",1,11
Catra," Cool, you found the Infinite Darkness room. Have fun, I'm gonna find another way around. ...Uh...where'd the door go?",1,11
Adora," Wait, I think I see something. Hello? Light Hope?",1,11
Catra, What's,1,11
Adora,  What kind of game are you playing?!,1,11
Catra,"  Whoa, whoa! I have no idea what's going on. There's no way we can actually be in the Fright Zone!",1,11
Adora,"  So what is this, another Shadow Weaver mind trick?!",1,11
Catra, I doubt it. Now let----go of me!,1,11
Catra," Hey, you! Guard. ...Uh, hello?  Hey, Adora! This isn't real! ...Adora?  Adora?!",1,11
Adora,  Catra?,1,11
Young Catra,  Adora! ,1,11
Catra,"  Hey, Adora? There's a--",1,11
Adora,  Shh.,1,11
Young Catra,  Does it look broken to you?! ,1,11
Young Adora,"  It's not broken, you're fine!",1,11
Young Catra,  I'm bleeding!,1,11
Young Adora, You're not bleeding! And why would you try and pick a fight with Octavia anyway?,1,11
Young Catra," I didn't do anything, all I did was exist near her. ...And scratch her on the eyeball. And call her a dumbface.",1,11
Young Adora,  Catra--,1,11
Young Catra, What?! She has a dumb face!,1,11
Young Adora,  Where is she?,1,11
Young Adora," Hey, Octavia!",1,11
Young Adora, You're a dumbface!,1,11
Young Catra,  She's coming!,1,11
Young Adora, Run!,1,11
Catra,  What was that?!,1,11
Adora," It must have been some kind of simulation. It's tapping into our memories. Why, I have no idea...",1,11
Catra,"  Ugh, this place is so weird. How can you deal with all of this magic stuff?",1,11
Adora,  I'm only dealing with it because I need to figure out how to heal Glimmer after someone got her cursed.,1,11
Catra,  What do you want? An apology?  You're not getting one.,1,11
Adora,  ...Can I ask you something?,1,11
Catra,  Can I stop you?,1,11
Adora, ...Why did you help me escape after Shadow Weaver captured us?,1,11
Catra,  Not this again.,1,11
Adora," It's the one thing I can't figure out. You didn't have to do that. You could've gotten caught...why risk it?  Whoa, whoa, whoa--!",1,11
Catra, Did you really think I'd just let Shadow Weaver erase your memory like that?,1,11
Adora, I dunno. Probably.,1,11
Catra," Yeah, well, you never did have too much faith in me.",1,11
Adora,  Can you blame me?,1,11
Catra,  Not really.,1,11
Catra," It wasn't all bad growing up in the Fright Zone, was it? I mean, you still have some good memories, right?",1,11
Adora," Of course I do. But it doesn't change the fact that the Horde is evil. I had no choice. I couldn't go back. ...Hey. I miss you, too.",1,11
Catra, Wha--?  I don't miss you.  Get over yourself!,1,11
Adora, Not until you admit you like me!,1,11
Catra, I don't like you!,1,11
Catra,"  Oh, come on!",1,11
Young Catra,  Oww!,1,11
Young Adora,  You okay?,1,11
Training Handler, And there's our winner.,1,11
Training Handler," Good work, cadet. I like your focus. This win will definitely be reported back to Lord Hordak.",1,11
Young Catra,  What was that? Way to gang up on me!,1,11
Young Lonnie, You were fighting dirty. I was just leveling the field.,1,11
Young Adora," Hey, you were awesome!  Did I hurt you?",1,11
Young Catra,"  No, I'm fine. You're just lucky I let you win.",1,11
Young Adora,  Right...,1,11
Young Catra," I'm serious!  If I came in first, people might expect me to actually start doing stuff around here. Trust me, second place suits me just fine.",1,11
Young Adora,"  Yeah, okay. Come on, let's go cool down.",1,11
Young Catra," In a minute, I'll meet you there.",1,11
Young Adora,"  Hey, guys, wait up!",1,11
Disembodied Hologram voice, Unauthorized presence detected. Security protocol activated.,1,11
Adora, Catra?  Catra!,1,11
Catra,  Adora!,1,11
Adora,  Catra! ,1,11
Catra,  Adora! ,1,11
Adora,  Are you okay?,1,11
Catra,  I had it.,1,11
Adora," Sure you did, we need to make sure we stay together from now on.",1,11
Catra, Will you stop telling me what to do?!,1,11
Catra,  I'm sick of this stupid place. Let's just get out of here.,1,11
Adora,  What is your problem? I was just trying to save you.,1,11
Catra," For the last time, I don't need you to save me. I've been doing just fine on my own. No thanks to you.",1,11
Adora,"  Catra, wait. ...I'm sorry for leaving. I couldn't go back to the Fright Zone, not after I saw what the Horde was really doing. I never wanted to leave you. ...You could come with me! You-you-you could join the rebellion! I know you're not a bad person, Catra. You don't belong with the Horde.",1,11
Catra,  Let's just get this over with.,1,11
Young Adora," Catra, wait up! ",1,11
Young Catra, What's it like being the world's slowest person?,1,11
Young Adora,  Whoa.,1,11
Young Catra,  It's open.,1,11
Young Adora, We're definitely not allowed in there. ,1,11
Adora, You don't have to go in there.,1,11
Young Catra,  Wow...,1,11
Young Adora,  Ma-maybe we should get out of here.,1,11
Shadow Weaver,  Get out!,1,11
Shadow Weaver, Catra...  ...you stay.,1,11
Shadow Weaver, What do you think you're doing in here?,1,11
Catra,  We were just playing.,1,11
Shadow Weaver,  Insolent child. I've come to expect such disgraceful behavior from you. But I will not allow you to drag Adora down as well.,1,11
Adora,"  Shadow Weaver, it wasn't her fault, it was my idea, too!",1,11
Shadow Weaver,"  You have never been anything more than a nuisance to me! I've kept you around this long because Adora was fond of you, but if you ever do anything to jeopardize her future, I will dispose of you myself.  Do you understand?",1,11
Young Adora,  Please stop!,1,11
Young Adora, She didn't mean to!,1,11
Shadow Weaver,"  Adora, you must do a better job of keeping her under control.  Do not let something like this happen again. ",1,11
Catra,"  You always need to play the hero, don't you?",1,11
Adora,  I was only trying to protect you.,1,11
Catra,  You never protected me! Not in any way that would put you on Shadow Weaver's bad side.,1,11
Young Catra,  Admit it. You love being her favorite!,1,11
Young Adora,  That's not true!,1,11
Young Catra," Oh, yeah? ] When you left, who do you think took the fall for you?  Who was protecting me then?",1,11
Adora, You don't have to let Shadow Weaver treat you like that anymore. You can leave----just like I did!,1,11
Young Catra," Oh, because I need to follow you everywhere you go?!",1,11
Young Adora,  I didn't mean it that way.,1,11
Catra,"  I don't. Want. To leave. What don't you understand about that? I'm not afraid of Shadow Weaver anymore, and I'm a better Force Captain than you would've ever been.",1,11
Young Adora,  You always said you didn't care about things like that...,1,11
Young Catra,"  Well, I was lying, obviously!",1,11
Adora,"  Catra, just wait!",1,11
Catra,"  Why do you think I gave the sword back to you in the Fright Zone? I didn't want you to come back, Adora!",1,11
Adora,  For the honor of-- Huh?,1,11
Young Lonnie, You were fighting dirty.,1,11
Shadow Weaver, Insolent child.,1,11
Adora," I'm sorry, Catra--",1,11
Catra,  Let. Me. OUT OF HERE!,1,11
Young Adora,  ...Catra?,1,11
Young Adora,"  Catra, it's okay, it's just me.  It doesn't matter what they do to us, you know? You look out for me, and I look out for you. Nothing really bad can happen as long as we have each other.",1,11
Young Catra, You promise?,1,11
Catra, You promise?,1,11
Young Adora, I promise.,1,11
Young Adora," ...Come on, let's go back out.",1,11
Adora," Stop it, I'm not your enemy. Light Hope... Just let me talk to Light Hope!",1,11
Adora,  Catra?,1,11
Catra,"  Hey, Adora.",1,11
Adora,"  Catra, help me, please...",1,11
Catra,"  This thing wouldn't work for me if I tried, would it? It only works for you. Then again, you're special. That's what Shadow Weaver always said.",1,11
Adora,  Catra...what are you doing?,1,11
Catra," Ah, you know? It all makes sense now. You've always been the one holding me back. You wanted me to think I needed you. You wanted me to feel weak. Every hero needs a sidekick, right?",1,11
Adora,"  Catra, no, that's not how it was...",1,11
Catra,"  The sad thing is, I've spent all this time hoping you'd come back to the Horde, when really you leaving was the best thing that ever happened to me.  I am so much stronger than anyone  ever thought.",1,11
Catra,  I wonder what I could've been if I'd gotten rid of you sooner...,1,11
Adora,  I-I'm sorry! I never meant to make you feel like you were second best! Please don't do this!,1,11
Catra," Bye, Adora. I really am going to miss you.",1,11
Adora,"  Catra! Catra, no! ",1,11
Light Hope, Adora.,1,11
Light Hope,  You must. Let. Go.,1,11
Scorpia,"  And then there's the day, Catra and I were on a boat together! Did I ever tell you about that?",1,11
Entrapta,  I'm pretty sure you did. ,1,11
Voice of Scorpia from the recorder," Oh, and one time, Catra and I, were on a boat together! That was the best day ever.",1,11
Entrapta," Yep, you did. ",1,11
Scorpia,"  I think that's really when we made our connection, you know?  You ever meet someone and you just instantly click?",1,11
Entrapta,"  Yes, it was like that with Emily.",1,11
Scorpia,  What happened to you? You're filthy! Are you okay? Do you need first aid? Do you need to be nursed tenderly back to health?!,1,11
Catra,"  Scorpia, remember that talk we had about personal space?",1,11
Scorpia," Oh, right. Ten-foot radius.",1,11
Entrapta, How'd it go? Did you find it?,1,11
Catra," Uh, why is the princess loose?",1,11
Entrapta," Ohhh, right.  Seriously, though, did you find it?",1,11
Entrapta,  An intact data crystal?  I have never seen one so perfectly preserved. This could be a game-changer. Who knows what secrets it could contain? ,1,11
Scorpia,"  Oh, man, I knew Catra could do it.  It's like I was telling you,  she is the best friend ever.",1,11
Catra, ...Just keep it down. I'm going to bed.,1,11
Light Hope," Hello, Adora.",1,12
Shadow Weaver, Adora...,1,12
Catra, Every hero needs a sidekick...right?,1,12
Adora, For the honor...of Grayskull!,1,12
Entrapta, I just need a little more time!,1,12
Light Hope," Hello, Adora.  You've come at last.",1,12
Adora," Light Hope... I can't believe I'm really seeing you. I mean, I've seen you  in my brain, I think. But this is real!  Is this real? Wait, am I dead? I fell...I'm sorry, I'm freaking out.  I'm Adora.",1,12
Light Hope," Yes, I know. I have been waiting for you since you were an infant, but I could not reach you. And I could not protect you from the Horde. I watched you grow up from afar.",1,12
Adora," Wow, that's--that's kind of creepy, honestly.",1,12
Light Hope," Creepy? Yes. I have been called this before. I chose this form so as not to alarm you, but if it does not suit you, I will choose another.",1,12
Light Hope, Is this better? ,1,12
Adora," Oh, no. That's--that's, um, that's definitely way worse.",1,12
Light Hope, Forgive me. My human protocol is many years out of date.  Allow me to select a new form that you will find appealing.,1,12
Adora," Ooh, no, no, that's, thank you! No, that's enough, tha--no, that's--that's, that's t-totally okay, please stop! ",1,12
Glimmer, But shouldn't she be  back by now? She said she was gonna  get training to  fix me! How long is that going to take-- OW!  And what kind of monster puts a chair here?!,1,12
Bow," Okay, I'm worried, too, Glimmer, but taking it out on the furniture isn't going to help.",1,12
Glimmer, We can't sit here and hope that she comes back eventually. We have to do something.,1,12
Bow, Like what?,1,12
Guard," Princess? There's, uh, something here to see you.",1,12
Glimmer, Don't you mean someone?,1,12
Guard, No. I mean something.,1,12
Bow, Our horse!,1,12
Swift Wind, I am my own horse. Call me  Swift Wind!,1,12
Bow, Our horse can talk! ,1,12
Swift Wind," Yeah, yeah, I can speak my mind now, pretty crazy--SO, I was thinking--",1,12
Bow, He's a talking hoOoOoOrse!,1,12
Swift Wind, As we've established. Now--,1,12
Glimmer, He has wings!,1,12
Swift Wind," Okay, I'll give you a moment to freak out, and then we need to talk.",1,12
Swift Wind,"  --Great! I think Adora needs our help. Since Adora transformed me, I've been able to feel where she is at all times. It's like instinct. But now I feel a pull, as if I'm being summoned to her side.",1,12
Swift Wind," As part of Adora's herd, I need your help. Will you come?",1,12
Glimmer, Of course. Lead the way.,1,12
Bow," But, Glimmer, your glitching.",1,12
Glimmer, Is what got us into this. Adora left to save me. Now it's time for us to save her. You in?,1,12
Bow, Always. But...I don't think your mom is going to like us leaving so soon after our last mission.,1,12
Glimmer, She doesn't need to know. We'll sneak out and be back before my mom even realizes we're gone.,1,12
Glimmer,  Mom!,1,12
Glimmer, What are you doing here?,1,12
Angella, Coming to see why my guard was escorting a horse into your room.,1,12
Swift Wind," I like to think of myself more as a role model for all horse kind. ...I mean, uh, what talking horse?  What's happening?",1,12
Angella, You should get going if you want to track down Adora.,1,12
Glimmer, You're not gonna stop us?,1,12
Angella," Glimmer. I told you I regretted giving up after your father died. I will not consign you to the same regrets.  Commander Glimmer. I order you to continue your mission to find Adora, and bring her back home.",1,12
Glimmer," Right away, Your Majesty. ...Come on!",1,12
Swift Wind," Uh, when we're back, I'd like to talk about freeing all the horses in your stables.  I think that's seriously--",1,12
Bow,  Later!,1,12
Swift Wind, Hey! Hey! I'm still talking to the queen! ,1,12
Angella, Please be careful.,1,12
Catra," Okay, I--what is going on here?",1,12
Entrapta,  Catra! You got my note.,1,12
Catra," The one you dropped on my head from the air vent that says, 'Come to my lab'?",1,12
Entrapta," Yes, that's the one. I've made great strides in analyzing the data from the First Ones data crystal you brought me... Look!",1,12
Catra, Where did all of this come from?,1,12
Entrapta," Oh, you know. Here and there...rooms...",1,12
Catra, Were there people in these rooms?,1,12
Entrapta," Well, not when I went back to take the stuff.",1,12
Catra,  You definitely belong here with us.,1,12
Entrapta, ...So! The data! ,1,12
Scorpia, Ha!  Wow!  Whoa. ,1,12
Entrapta," Look at these readings. It's incredible, this seems to confirm my theories about the techno-organic nature of First Ones machinery resulting in thaumaturlogical compatibility between magic and science! ",1,12
Catra," I'm going to need you to try again, but this time, talk like a normal person.",1,12
Entrapta, Scorpia seems like she understands.,1,12
Catra, Scorpia is drawing stick figures holding hands.,1,12
Scorpia," I call it 'Super Pal Trio'! This is me, this is Catra, and I think it's clear, come on. I mean, I'm a bit of an artist.",1,12
Entrapta,"  I looked at the rock, which is a crys-tal, and used math...wait, do I have to explain math to you?",1,12
Catra,"  Yes or no, did the crystal give you enough data to upgrade our weapons?",1,12
Entrapta," Weapons? HA! This is so much bigger than weapons. This could change everything. Etheria's not just a planet. Whatever the First Ones did to it, it went deep.",1,12
Catra, And what does that mean?,1,12
Entrapta," You're asking me about my theories? I've waited years for someone to ask me about my theories! Hang on, I made a model!",1,12
Adora," I don't want to be rude, but, um...who are you?",1,12
Light Hope," I am Light Hope, Etheria's facilitator. I was created by the First Ones, as you call them.",1,12
Adora," Okay, quick follow-up...who are the First Ones?",1,12
Light Hope, The First Ones were explorers who journeyed from beyond the stars to settle Etheria. They built this place for you...the Crystal Castle.,1,12
Light Hope," Adora, I've waited so long for you, and now the time has come to show you your destiny.",1,12
Adora," Great, because I actually had a quest--",1,12
Light Hope," You are She-Ra, Etheria's champion, appointed by the First Ones to protect and unite our planet. There have been many before you, but the line was broken.  You are the first She-Ra in a thousand years.",1,12
Entrapta," Behold! Etheria. The First Ones didn't just settle on the surface of Etheria, their technology runs throughout the planet's core. This whole planet it's--it's all First Ones' tech.",1,12
Light Hope," Everything on Etheria is connected. The princesses are granted power over the elements through their Runestones. As She-Ra, it is your duty to bring the princesses together. Only then can balance be restored to Etheria.",1,12
Adora,"  That sounds great, but the things is--",1,12
Light Hope, You are correct. It is great.,1,12
Catra, And what are these supposed to be?,1,12
Entrapta," Runestones. From the data I've managed to extract, they regulate the planet through the princesses. They're directly connected to each other and to the planet's power grid in a delicate balance.",1,12
Catra, Which means?,1,12
Entrapta, Which means they're our best access point to hack the planet.,1,12
Light Hope," When the princesses and their elements are in balance, Etheria functions as it should.  But the Horde is destroying us in their quest for power. There is no predicting what they will do next.",1,12
Catra, Hack the planet?,1,12
Entrapta," Hypothetically, but it's not so simple. There's only a handful of Runestones in the whole world.",1,12
Scorpia, Runestone? You mean like the Black Garnet? 'Cause  we have the Black Garnet.,1,12
Entrapta, The Black Garnet? You have a Runestone? The Fright Zone has a Runestone?,1,12
Scorpia," Uh, duh. It was my family's. But when the Horde landed, we gave it to Hordak, who then gave it to Shadow Weaver, who--you know, you tell a friend, he tells a friend, it's like, it's kind of one of those things.",1,12
Entrapta,"  Where is it?! Can I see it, can I touch it?!",1,12
Catra," Okay, calm down. What exactly are you planning on doing to the Black Garnet?",1,12
Entrapta," If we hack the Runestone grid, we could boost the Garnet's power and use it for...well, anything. As a power source, as--",1,12
Catra, A weapon?,1,12
Entrapta," Potentially! But if it's like my other experiments, the results will be explosive.",1,12
Scorpia, I don't think Shadow Weaver will like that.,1,12
Catra," Scorpia's right. Shadow Weaver won't like it. ...So, I will absolutely get you the Black Garnet. Leave it all to me.",1,12
Hordak," What do you have for me, little spy?",1,12
Adora," This is all super good information, um, and I can't wait to hear more  just one thing, though--",1,12
Light Hope," Is there something you do not understand? I can start again from the beginning, if you would like.  I am Light Hope, Etheria's facilitator--",1,12
Adora," No, no, I got it.",1,12
Light Hope, Have I mentioned that you are chosen?,1,12
Adora, Can we skip to the part about my powers? I need to learn how to heal my friend.,1,12
Light Hope, Your...friend?,1,12
Adora, Yes. Shadow Weaver did something to Glimmer and took her powers away. I need to figure out how to heal her.,1,12
Light Hope, Her connection with her Runestone was disrupted.,1,12
Adora, Can I fix it?,1,12
Light Hope, You will be able to do many incredible things...with training.,1,12
Adora," Great. So, uh, how long will this training take--like a day, or--",1,12
Light Hope, Years.,1,12
Adora," Years?! Glimmer doesn't have years. She's hurt because of me, I messed up. I got Glimmer and Bow captured, and Entrapta--it's my fault! ...I have to fix it.",1,12
Light Hope," Yes, your mission is to fix the planet.",1,12
Adora, My mission is to help my friends. That's why I came here.,1,12
Light Hope, You are She-Ra. Your purpose is to protect all of Etheria. You cannot help only your friends.,1,12
Adora, Why can't I do both?,1,12
Light Hope," Adora, you do not yet realize the power you have.  You are distracted by your attachments. There was one before you who could not let go. Her name was Mara.",1,12
Adora, Mara? Madame Razz's Mara? What happened to her?,1,12
Light Hope, Mara was the last She-Ra before you. She struggled with a power that she could not control. Until it became too much for her mind.,1,12
Adora, ...She snapped?,1,12
Light Hope, She was compromised. She gave in to fear and faulty reasoning. Her desperate actions led to devastation. Mara stranded us in the empty dimension of Despandos. She broke the She-Ra line. She nearly destroyed us.,1,12
Light Hope, ...Adora. I have waited here for a thousand years alone. I did not know if I would ever see another She-Ra. You must stay here and train. Learn to be the She-Ra that Mara could not be.,1,12
Adora," I will. I will do whatever you want. I'll come back, and train, and learn about everything. But I have to heal Glimmer first. I can save the planet and save her.",1,12
Catra, Adora? ,1,12
Entrapta, I just need a little more time--I just need a little more time! ,1,12
Light Hope," You feel guilt at these memories. It is as you said, your friends are endangered by your presence. It is better to let go now.",1,12
Adora, But...I can't just leave my friends...,1,12
Catra," Alright, hurry it up, those machines aren't going to hook up themselves.",1,12
Shadow Weaver,  They won't be hooked up at all.,1,12
Scorpia,"  Shadow Weaver! Uh----We just, uh--",1,12
Shadow Weaver,"  Silence! Did you really think you could invade my inner sanctum without me noticing? I never thought you were so bold as to openly rebel, but it will be my pleasure to put you back in your place!",1,12
Catra," Oh, Shadow Weaver. I can do whatever I want with this hunk of rock.",1,12
Shadow Weaver,"  Absurd, by whose authority?",1,12
Hordak, By mine.,1,12
Shadow Weaver,  Lord Hordak! I don't understand.,1,12
Hordak," Catra and Entrapta have been working on a way to meld this strange First Ones tech with our machines to weaponize it. I found out......and was intrigued. I gave Force Captain Catra and her team my blessing to go ahead. ...So, understand, Shadow Weaver. I am displeased with your interruption.",1,12
Shadow Weaver,"  My Lord, you're really going to let this--this princess tinker with my Runestone?!",1,12
Hordak," Her tinkering has increased the firepower of every weapon she's touched. So yes, she gets to tinker with whatever she wants. Including the Black Garnet, which is mine to give or take, as I see fit.",1,12
Shadow Weaver," You can't... You can't do this! I alone have learned how to draw power from it, a feat no sorceress has done before! I have unlocked its potential!",1,12
Hordak," And you wasted it on parlor tricks. Force Captain Catra, proceed. The Garnet is yours.",1,12
Catra," Yes, Lord Hordak.",1,12
Shadow Weaver,  NO!,1,12
Catra,  Stop her! Don't let her touch the--,1,12
Shadow Weaver, You will not take what is mine!,1,12
Shadow Weaver," That's right, run away. It's the only thing you've ever been good at!  You have always been a disappointment. You've learned nothing from me!",1,12
Catra," Oh, no. I've learned everything from you. How to predict when you'll strike, how to dodge, how to resist. You thought you were punishing me all these years? Wrong. You were training me for this day!",1,12
Shadow Weaver,  NO!,1,12
Shadow Weaver,  Come back...Come back to me! Come back to me!,1,12
Catra," Scorpia, restrain the sorceress.  We won't have to worry about her any longer. Entrapta, if you would.",1,12
Entrapta," Alright, everyone. Let's get weird.",1,12
Scorpia,  Look!,1,12
Swift Wind," And then I realized I'm free, but the other horses aren't. So I named myself Swift Wind after the swift winds of revolution and left to go kick down stable doors. Freedom, equality, and hay for all!",1,12
Glimmer, Do you guys hear that?,1,12
Bow, Get behind me!,1,12
Glimmer, What was that about?,1,12
Swift Wind,"  I feel something. We should run. ...No. We have to get Adora. Adora, then run.",1,12
Bow," Swift Wind, what is it?",1,12
Swift Wind,  A bad thing. Hurry. ,1,12
Entrapta, Amazing! The Garnet is siphoning energy at a near exponential rate. Yet the output is still building...!,1,12
Catra, What does that mean?,1,12
Entrapta, It means things are getting interesting.,1,12
Bow," Is it just me, or is it really cold?",1,12
Glimmer, It's...snowing?,1,12
Bow, That's impossible. It never snows in the Whispering Woods.,1,12
Glimmer, What's happening?!,1,12
Swift Wind, The bad thing!,1,12
Bow," We can't stay here! Swift Wind, do you sense Adora?",1,12
Swift Wind,  There! She's over there!,1,12
Glimmer,  This would be a great time for my powers to come back!,1,12
Swift Wind," Wait...wait! I know this. Hang on, I think I can--",1,12
Bow, What is that?!,1,12
Swift Wind, Uh...this way!,1,12
Glimmer, Adora!,1,12
Bow, Adora! We're here! Wake up!,1,12
Swift Wind, I think I can reach her. Hold on. ,1,12
Glimmer,  Swift Wind?,1,12
Bow,  Uh...Glimmer?,1,12
Light Hope,  The Horde is hurting us. Balance Etheria.,1,12
Adora,"  Light Hope? Light Hope, come back! I don't--I don't know what to do.",1,12
Swift Wind,  Adoraa... Adora!,1,12
Adora, Our horse?,1,12
Swift Wind," Once again, I'm no one's horse. I'm Swift Wind.",1,12
Adora,  You can talk?,1,12
Swift Wind," Yes, I can talk.",1,12
Adora,  You can talk?,1,12
Swift Wind," I can see now why you're friends with Bow and Glimmer. They need your help, which is why I'm here. So....which way's the exit?",1,12
Adora, I don't know. Light Hope disappeared and I-I don't know if I should go back.,1,12
Swift Wind, What do you mean?,1,12
Adora," Light Hope said if I leave here, I'll make things worse. She's right. Everyone will be better off if I just stay far away from them. It's-It's for the greater good.",1,12
Swift Wind,"  Well, that's just stupid.",1,12
Adora,"  What? No, it's not.",1,12
Swift Wind," Adora, I've had the ability to form complex thought for like...a week, and even I know you can't help anyone by hiding. Where would all the horses I freed from their barns be if I just sat in a pasture and moped?",1,12
Adora,  I am not moping...,1,12
Adora," I'm not! I hurt people, I ruined my friends' lives!",1,12
Swift Wind," If that's true, then why are Bow and Glimmer here trying to rescue you?",1,12
Swift Wind," Bow and Glimmer are risking their lives. Not because you're She-Ra, but because you're their friend. What good is all your power if you don't use it to help the people that you love?",1,12
Adora," ...I'm not Mara. I'm not the She-Ras of the past. I didn't do this to fulfill some destiny. I became She-Ra to help others. My attachments, my friends, are a part of who I am.",1,12
Swift Wind, So. Are you staying? Or going?,1,12
Adora, Let's go.,1,12
Glimmer,  Adora! You're back!,1,12
Bow,  Adora! Spiders!,1,12
Adora, For the honor...of Grayskull!,1,12
She-Ra," Now, Swifty!",1,12
Swift Wind, Hold on!,1,12
Bow," Guys, look!",1,12
Glimmer, It's not just the woods...it's...,1,12
Adora, It's the entire world.,1,12
Glimmer,"  Bright Moon. Swift Wind, hurry!",1,12
Scorpia, Wow... What do you think it's doing?,1,12
Catra, I don't know. But I can work with this.,1,12
Adora," It's coming from the Fright Zone! Whatever's happening, the Horde is causing it!""",1,13
Bow, The Whispering Woods are freezing over! What'll we do?,1,13
Glimmer," We have to get home! We have to make sure everyone at Bright Moon is okay.""",1,13
Scorpia, Catra! You've gotta see this!,1,13
Scorpia," Tidal waves, Fire Storms, Earthquakes.. maaaan, Etheria's really taking this hard. I mean-- Yay for us but also woe.""",1,13
Catra,  Translate.,1,13
Entrapta,"  By making the black garnet more powerful, we've sapped power from the other princesses Runestones, upsetting the balance and making the weather go screwy. It's all in my notes if you'd like to--""",1,13
Catra, Woa woa woa woa wait! What was that you just said about making the other princesses less powerful?,1,13
Entrapta," Well the Elemental princesses that is, You don't have to worry about me and Scorpia. I don't have a runestone and Scorpia doesn't appear to have any connection to the Black Garnet anymore-- if she ever did.""",1,13
Scorpia," Huh? Somebody say my name?""",1,13
Catra," And how would we make an effect like that... Permanent?""",1,13
Entrapta," Well, I'd have to run more Tests to know for Sure but--""",1,13
Entrapta," Or yeah, that should work too.",1,13
Catra," Get a strike team together, we're going to Bright Moon.",1,13
Scorpia, Bright Moon? Why?,1,13
Catra," Because, we're going to take out Bright Moon's Runestone, and with the Whispering Woods frozen over... there's nothing stopping us.",1,13
Bow, Look! ,1,13
Glimmer,  That's Bright Moon! It's the distress beacon.,1,13
Swift-Wind, Hang on!,1,13
Glimmer, Mom!  What's going on?,1,13
Angella,  The elements are out of harmony. The Moonstone is using all its power to counteract the growing cloud of darkness.... but it's not enough. It's taking nearly all my strength just to keep my connection with it.,1,13
Adora, That cloud is coming from the Fright Zone,1,13
Bow, So what's our plan? We do have a plan.. right? Guys?,1,13
Adora,  The woods are frozen over. There's nothing left to shield Bright Moon from the Horde. We have to prepare for an attack.,1,13
Bow," our scouts have reported citing the entire Horde Army in the woods, moving towards us at top speed.",1,13
Angella," We must protect Bright Moon at all costs. If the moonstone is destroyed, there will be nothing left to stop the darkness,",1,13
Bow," Someone must've seen the distress beacon by now, why hasn't anyone come?",1,13
Adora, The Alliance is broken and other princesses have their own kingdoms to protect.  No one's coming Bow.,1,13
Guard, Someone's come!,1,13
Bow,  Is it the princesses?,1,13
Bow,"  Oh.  Spinnerella and Netossa ha ha, thanks for coming guys...",1,13
Netassa," You still don't know what we do, do you?",1,13
Bow, Aaaah.. no.,1,13
Netassa," Seriously?! It's in the name, NET- Tossa.  NETS, I toss NETS! Okay?",1,13
Spinnerella," Yes darling, you have beautiful nets.",1,13
Glimmer," At least you have powers, which is more than I've got. But it doesn't matter. I don't need magic to fight!",1,13
Angella,"  Glimmer, not only are you without your powers but your still glitching, it's too dangerous.",1,13
Glimmer, But mom!,1,13
Adora," Your mom is right Glimmer, I don't want any of you risking yourselves. She-Ra can do this alone. This is what she's for.",1,13
Bow," Adora, not even She-Ra can take on an army of Horde soldiers ALL on her own.",1,13
Adora,  Than what good is she?,1,13
Glimmer, Adora... are you okay?,1,13
Adora, Catra will be leading the Horde when they attack. I have to face her. I can't let her hurt anyone else.,1,13
Glimmer, What happened to you in that first one's temple?,1,13
Adora," I saw Catra in there. I thought I could get through to her, but all I did was push her farther to the side of evil. Light Hope said that I'd endanger my friends by coming back and she was right. Everything that's happening now is my fault...",1,13
Glimmer, You've got this. And we've got your back.,1,13
Glimmer," Now come on, the Horde will be here soon. We have to be ready.",1,13
Glimmer, welcome to the Bright Moon armory! Well it's not really but I've been sneaking weapons and stashing them in here for months! ,1,13
Bow, Dibs on arrows! ,1,13
Adora,Aaaaah... no. ,1,13
Angella, Glimmer.,1,13
Glimmer, Ah ma mom! How'd you know we'd be in here?,1,13
Angella, Did you really think I wouldn't notice you were hoarding weapons?,1,13
Glimmer,  I'm sorry mom. I can't just stand by while my friends and my home are in danger. I have to do this.,1,13
Angella, I know,1,13
Glimmer," Mom I... wait, what?",1,13
Angella," I've been trying all these years to mold you into someone more like me... but you're too stubborn and hotheaded, and brave.. like your father.  This was your father's staff, I think it's time you had it.",1,13
Adora, They're here.  For the honor of Grayskull!,1,13
Bow, We got this. Right?,1,13
Adora, Yeah.... Definitely.,1,13
Glimmer, They're going to be sorry they ever tried to mess with Bright Moon.,1,13
Adora, Defend the Castle.,1,13
Glimmer, Adora!  She-Ra need's our help.,1,13
Angella, Go to her. I'll keep The Moonstone lit in the darkness away from the battlefield as long as I can,1,13
Swift-Wind, You heard the Queen  For the rebellion!,1,13
Catra, Hey Adora.,1,13
Adora, Catra  Surprised to see me?,1,13
Catra," Not really, I figured it wouldn't be that easy to get rid of you.",1,13
Catra," You know, I'm actually glad you did make it out of there alive.... because now..  I can take you out myself.",1,13
Scorpia, Well isn't that nice? You've accessorized! Not that it's going to help you!,1,13
Netassa, Boom! Nets!,1,13
Catra, Tired already? I thought punching was supposed to be like-- the one thing you're good at.,1,13
Adora, And I thought you were supposed to be quicker.,1,13
Adora," Give it up Catra, there's no way you win this.",1,13
Catra,  I already made it a lot further than anyone thought I would.,1,13
Catra," You on the other hand, you're not looking so good.",1,13
Adora, This isn't over!,1,13
Catra, OF COURSE it's not over!,1,13
Catra, It won't be over until Bright Moon is destroyed and the rebellion falls. It won't be OVER until darkness covers Etheria forever. And it won't be over until I see the looks on your friends' faces when they find out you failed. That you were too WEAK to save them!,1,13
Adora, Enough! You've lost Catra.,1,13
Catra,  You sure about that?,1,13
Catra, What? Did you really think this was about you?,1,13
Catra, That Runestone is your last defense.... isn't it? HAHAHAHA! Have fun!,1,13
Glimmer, NO! ,1,13
Scorpia," So where were we? Oh yeah, I Was about to punch you!",1,13
Adora, Where's my shield? {She searches the water],1,13
Bow, uuh ohh. ,1,13
Scorpia," Huu, Pretty!",1,13
Catra," Now, it's over.",1,13
Swift-wind, Come on!,1,13
Glimmer, Oh mom!,1,13
Swift-Wind, Princess!,1,13
Bow, Adora? Adora!,1,13
Bow," Come on,  Don't give up yet. Please! We can still fix this, right?  Please tell me we can fix this.",1,13
Adora," ah.. I.. I am sorry, ",1,13
Bow," it's okay, ",1,13
Sea Hawk, inaudible ,1,13
Mermista, Don't do that.,1,13
Sea Hawk, Sorry.,1,13
Adora, Mermista! Sea Hawk! You Came!,1,13
Mermista," Yea- sorry it so long, the sea kiiiinda sucked today.",1,13
Catra," Come on, GET UP!",1,13
Perfuma, I saw the distress beacon are you all okay?,1,13
Adora, No!,1,13
Adora, No! You're right on time!,1,13
Adora, FOR ETHERIA!,1,13
Angella, Go on. Go get them,1,13
Glimmer, YES!,1,13
Bow," Ha Ha, Glimmer! Your sparkling again!",1,13
Glimmer, Yeah! What I miss?,1,13
Adora, The Princesses are united! This is how it's supposed to be.,1,13
Mermista, What do you say? Ready to finish this?,1,13
Perfuma,  Thought you'd never ask,1,13
Netassa, We're in,1,13
Frosta, Let's do this already,1,13
Bow," Adora, it's over! Bright Moon is saved.",1,13
Glimmer, And the princesses are finally united! We did it!,1,13
Mermista," That is how it's done in the SEA, really good job",1,13
Netossa, GOOD job Girls! ON to the next.,1,13
Frosta, Yeah! We did things ToGEther!,1,13
Perfuma, Isn't this wonderful! Ha ha!,1,13
Angella, Thank you.,1,13
"[Adora powers down to her normal self, tears in her eyes, still caught between her two friends. Meanwhile, Catra failed, and must face Hordak.",,1,13
Hordak," Force Captain, it seems your experiment has failed",1,13
Entrapta," ON THE CONTRARY! The experiment was a huge success, I know more about first one's tech than ever, this is Just the beginning.",1,13
Catra," I got us closer to conquering Bright Moon than anyone ever has, not to mention the whispering woods is still in ruins. Etheria is ours for the taking.",1,13
Hordak," Very Well, force captain Catra.... you will have other chances to prove your worth to me... As my second in command,",1,13
Catra, The cities forces have all fled. Dryl is ours.,2,02
Scorpia," All right. I mean I guess it, kind of, was already ours since they're Princess is on our side and all, but the banners, they really make it feei official.",2,02
Catra, Where are you?,2,02
Scorpia," That is a great question and the answer is ""I do not know"". Yea, this place is some kind of maze.",2,02
Catra,  There. That's me. Follow it out when you're done. And hurry up we have work to do.,2,02
Adora," Whewh, getting pretty good huh?",2,02
Light Hope, You have shown improvement. But your attack would have been 57% more effective if you had support from your steed. It is time to bring Swift Wind into your training.,2,02
Adora," Um, shouldn't I work on mastering my own abilities first?",2,02
Light Hope," As She-Ra, your sacred connection with your steed is as important as any of your physical abilities. He is a part of you, your destinies are intertwined.",2,02
Swift Wind," They sure are! Hi, Adora! I've been here a while but there wasn't a good time for me to make my grand entrance, until now.",2,02
Light Hope, I requested his presence. The time has come for the two of you to forge your sacred-- ,2,02
Glimmer," What do you mean? ""Entrapta's alive""?",2,02
Bow, I couldn't figure out how the Horde was making such big technological advances. But it all makes sense now. They must be holding Entrapta prisoner. I found First Ones tech in this bot. This is what Entrapta was experimenting on before she...,2,02
Glimmer, Before we left her behind in the Fright Zone.,2,02
Bow, We didn't know.,2,02
Glimmer," It doesn't matter. We should have gone back for her. We should've tried. She got captured trying to save us. Well, we're not just leaving her there now. We've got to rescue her.",2,02
Bow, How? We can't just walk into the Fright Zone. That's how we got in this mess in the first place.,2,02
Glimmer, Maybe we don't have to. Look.,2,02
Bow," No, the Horde took Dryl.",2,02
Glimmer," We just got word. The Horde has Entrapta, now they have Dryl. The timing can't be a coincidence.",2,02
Bow, Of course. They're making her use her own lab.,2,02
Glimmer," We're going to Crypto Castle, we'll find Entrapta and bring her back. No Princess left behind.",2,02
Bow, Yes! Totally on board. Let's get Adora.,2,02
Glimmer, Adora is out training with Light Hope.,2,02
Bow, What about the other Princesses?,2,02
Glimmer," Entrapta got taken trying to save us, Bow. I'm not going to be responsible for losing anyone else.",2,02
Adora," Uhhh, Light Hope?",2,02
Swift Wind, Did I break her? Was it when I went through her head?,2,02
Light Hope, The time has come for the two of you to forge your sacred bond. --I -- Is there something wrong?,2,02
Swift Wind," Well, I, yea. You kind of froze there for a second.",2,02
Adora, Are you okay?,2,02
Light Hope," Forgive me, my system is overloading. I may have to delay today's training so that I can rest.",2,02
Adora, Is there anything that I can do to help?,2,02
Light Hope," Perhaps. This is the Watchtower. Once it allowed me to access my planetary mainframe. But it was destroyed by Mara when she lost control and attacked the planet. I have been functioning at only a fraction of my power ever since. If you can repair the Watchtower, my capabilities will improve, and training can commence.",2,02
Adora," Fix the Watchtower, got it.",2,02
Light Hope, Only then -- ,2,02
Adora," Okay, so we're just gonna... We're just gonna go.",2,02
Bow, Any sign of Entrapta in the castle?,2,02
Glimmer, Nothing. And as usual that place is impossible to navigate.,2,02
Kyle, Hello? Please say you're on your way back. I need backup! Entrapta's new invention has lost it!,2,02
Entrapta," Bot #437 seems to be having some sort of existential crisis. Down, boy, down! ",2,02
Catra," Pull it together Kyle, you're fine.",2,02
Entrapta," Stop it! Please, why are you doing this to me?",2,02
Bow," Entrapta, she's really alive.",2,02
Glimmer, And they're hurting her.,2,02
Bow, Wait!,2,02
Glimmer, Where is she?,2,02
Bow, Glimmer we've got to get out of her now!,2,02
Catra, Get them!,2,02
Bow, Wait. Isn't this where we started?,2,02
Glimmer, I hate this place!,2,02
Catra, I see the rebels have sent their finest.,2,02
Glimmer, Bow!,2,02
Bow," Glimmer, wake up!",2,02
Catra, What did you just do to me?,2,02
Bow, Get back.,2,02
Swift Wind,"  Adora and Swift Wind, on an adventure. Fix'n a thing that Mara broke. When she went nuts.",2,02
Adora," Swift Wind, could you not do that?",2,02
Swift Wind, Just trying to keep us entertained while we look for this Watchtower. Any sign of it?,2,02
Adora, There's nothing here but grass. Maybe Light Hope got the location wrong.,2,02
Swift Wind," No, I don't think she did. I definitely sense something here, something ancient and magical.",2,02
Adora, Where?,2,02
Swift Wind," I'm not sure. Perhaps if we were to combine our efforts, my intuitive powers might increase.",2,02
Adora," No that's ok. I just, just have to keep looking. It has to be here somewhere.",2,02
Swift Wind," I could be wrong, but I'm sensing something's bothering you.",2,02
Adora, I'm just really focused on fixing Light Hope. Like you should be.,2,02
Swift Wind," No, you're troubled about something else. As your magnificent steed I am attuned to your emotions.",2,02
Adora," Okay, can you stay out of my head, please?",2,02
Swift Wind, I'm not in your head. You're just very bad at hiding your feelings. Is it about me?,2,02
Adora," I'm fine and no, it's not about you.",2,02
Swift Wind, Is it Bow? Glimmer? Catra? The Horde? The crushing weight of your new responsibilities as the savior of Etheria?,2,02
Adora," Stop. I'm fine, I promise. Just... let me think.",2,02
Swift Wind, Okay. I'm gonna do a few loop-de-loops.,2,02
Adora, Hey! Swift Wind.,2,02
Swift Wind, What's up?,2,02
Adora, I think I found the Watchtower.,2,02
Bow, We took a hostage! We're supposed to be the good guys. Maybe we should just let her go...,2,02
Glimmer, Let her go? Did she let us go? No! She let the Horde torture us.,2,02
Bow," Uh, yeah, because she's a bad guy.",2,02
Glimmer," Listen. We didn't mean for this to happen. But it did, and now we should use it to our advantage. We're taking you to Bright Moon. If your people want you back they'll have to give us Entrapta.",2,02
Catra, Entrapta? Who's that?,2,02
Glimmer, We know you have her! Where is she? What are you doing to her?,2,02
Bow, Glimmer.,2,02
Catra," Ohhh, Entrapta. You mean the Princess you left behind to die? Ha. Don't worry. We're taking good care of her.",2,02
Glimmer, On your feet Horde scum.,2,02
Catra, Whoops. I can't walk. Unless you want to untie me.,2,02
Glimmer, Nice try. I'll just teleport us there.,2,02
Bow," Uh, Glimmer, can I talk to you real quick? Bright Moon is pretty far away. Shouldn't you wait until we get closer to teleport us there? You don't want to run out of power and get us stuck out here. Especially with her.",2,02
Glimmer, Fine.,2,02
Swift Wind, Wow. Mara really did a number on this place.,2,02
Adora," So, let's put it back together. For the Honor of Grayskull!",2,02
Swift Wind, She-Ra and Swift Wind. Forging a sacred bond. Fixing a magic tower. With a magical sword.,2,02
Bow," Hey, are you okay?",2,02
Catra, Like you care.,2,02
Bow," We do, actually. The Rebellion treats it's prisoners with compassion.",2,02
Catra, You princess-types have to be about the bleeding hearts. Everything with you is about the power of friendship. How's that working out for you?,2,02
Bow, Come on. I bet even the Horde has friends. What about Adora?,2,02
Bow," You two grew up together, right? What was she like as a kid?",2,02
Bow, Glimmer and I have known each other forever too. She'd teleport to the roof to get my lost arrows when I was learning to shoot.,2,02
Catra," Wow, you two must be really close? Sounds like Glimmer would do anything for you, huh?",2,02
Bow, Absolutely. She's my best friend.,2,02
Catra, Good to know.,2,02
Glimmer, Bow!,2,02
Catra," Oh, hey princess.",2,02
Glimmer, How are you such a nightmare?!,2,02
Catra," Ah, years of practice.",2,02
Bow, Can we please discuss this when we're not hurtling to our deaths?,2,02
Glimmer, You know what? I'm ready to see if cats really do land on their feet?,2,02
Bow," Please don't do that, she is attached to me! Glimmer!",2,02
Glimmer,  Okay.,2,02
Glimmer, Not a fan of water huh? Get off of me!,2,02
Bow, Glimmer! Help!,2,02
Bow," Okay, ready to be rescued from this whenever you are.",2,02
Glimmer, Just need a minute to rest.,2,02
Bow," Um, what could you do with ten seconds?",2,02
Catra, Seriously? You guys are terrible at this.,2,02
Catra, At least we're all in one piece. Can't say the same for Entrapta.,2,02
Bow," Glimmer, are you ok?",2,02
Catra, Aww. What's wrong? Sleepy after all that magic?,2,02
Glimmer," I'm fine. You're not worth my time. C'mon, it's a long walk to Bright Moon. Put more ropes on her.",2,02
Scorpia," What do you mean there's no sign of her? Where could they have gone? Think, think Scorpia. Do we tell Hordak? Send out a search-party? Put up posters? How are we gonna find Catra? I mean if somebody has touched a hair on her head, I don't know... huh?",2,02
Scorpia,"  Oh, she's signaling us. We can follow this right to her. Catra, you beautiful genius, I'm coming!",2,02
Swift Wind, Try concentrating. Focus the She-Ra. She-Ra...,2,02
Adora, I can't concentrate when you're distracting me! This worked in Salineas.,2,02
Swift Wind," Hey, you know what might help? Loop-de-loops, with me. Get on my back.",2,02
Adora," Swift Wind, you're not taking this seriously.",2,02
Swift Wind, I'm just saying everything's better with loop-de-loops.,2,02
Adora," It's fine, I got this.",2,02
Adora), Still got this.,2,02
Catra," I don't know about you guys, but I'm beat. Getting held hostage is so much work.  Almost as exhausting as torturing Entrapta every day.",2,02
Glimmer, Uhg. Just ignore her.,2,02
Catra, You're looking pretty tired too princess. Running out of glitter?,2,02
Glimmer," Bow, can't you keep her mouth shut?",2,02
Bow," I tried, but she bites.",2,02
Glimmer," How did Adora take years of this? She didn't run away from the Horde, she ran away from you.",2,02
Catra," And where is she now? Off being She-Ra? Get used to it. You think she's not going to leave you behind, too, Sparkles?",2,02
Scorpia, Don't move!,2,02
She-Ra, How's that look?,2,02
Swift Wind," You know what? I don't think that one goes there after all. In fact, it might be upside down. Maybe you should take it all apart and start again? You seem stressed. Why don't we list all our favorite things until we feel better? I'll go first. Apples, hay, toppling unjust hierarchies, apples... Wait, I said that already.",2,02
She-Ra, What are you doing?,2,02
Swift Wind, I'm helping! I'm She-Ra's steed and that's what I do.,2,02
She-Ra, This isn't helping! Can you just...,2,02
Swift Wind, Adora!,2,02
Scorpia," Catra, are you okay? Did they hurt you? I will crush them.",2,02
Glimmer, She's fine. We want to make a trade. We'll release Catra if you release Entrapta.,2,02
Catra, I have a better trade. You release me right now or we'll finish Entrapta off once and for all.,2,02
Bow, What?,2,02
Glimmer, She's bluffing.,2,02
Catra," Scorpia, get Kyle on the comm.",2,02
Entrapta," No, no, no! Wait! Oh no.",2,02
Kyle," Force Captain, I knew you'd call me back. What do I do?",2,02
Catra," If you don't hear back from me in thirty seconds, take Entrapta out.",2,02
Kyle, What?,2,02
Entrapta, Just relax. We'll figure this out. Everything's okay.,2,02
Glimmer), Two can play at that game.,2,02
Scorpia, Catra! If you touch her again...,2,02
Catra," Easy there Big Gal, she's not going to try anything. They're noble rebels after all. They play by the rules.",2,02
Bow," Glimmer, stop!",2,02
Glimmer," This isn't fair. After everything she's done? After what she did to us? We're just supposed to let her go? How do we know they'd really get rid of Entrapta, Bow? They need her.",2,02
Bow, We can't take that chance. We're not them.,2,02
Scorpia, Oh. Oh! Come here! Come on. I'm just so glad this nightmare is over.,2,02
Catra, Wow. I didn't think you'd actually buy that.,2,02
Glimmer," We held up our end of the bargain. Now, show us that Entrapta's alive.",2,02
Catra," You and Adora are perfect for each other, I'll give you that. Earnest, naive, ridiculously easy to manipulate. It's adorable. And it's why you're never going to win.  Kyle, if you actually took me seriously just then, call it off.",2,02
Entrapta, Kyle isn't available at the moment.,2,02
Entrapta," But I've got it under control. Don't worry, this was just the prototype. The next model will be much, much bigger.",2,02
Bow, Entrapta? What's going on?,2,02
Catra, Oh hey. You wanna talk to her?,2,02
Entrapta," Oh, hi Bow. What are you doing there?",2,02
Glimmer," Just hang on Entrapta, we're going to rescue you.",2,02
Entrapta, Oh good! Rescue me from what?,2,02
Glimmer, From the Horde!,2,02
Entrapta," Oh, well, that's nice of you. But all of my stuff is here now, so probably I'll just stay. Thanks anyway though.",2,02
Bow," Entrapta, are you on the Horde's side now?",2,02
Entrapta," I'm on the side of science. But I am living at the Fright Zone now, and the Horde is supplying me with tools and materials for my work. So, yes? I guess?",2,02
Catra, Did I forget to mention that? Ha. Oops.,2,02
Entrapta, But don't worry about me. I love it here. I've made unbelievable progress in my research. And the Horde has been so supportive. I'm getting closer every day to unraveling the mysteries of Etheria. Hacking the Black Garnet was just the first step.,2,02
Bow, That was you?,2,02
Catra, So much for the power of friendship.,2,02
Bow," Come on Glimmer, lets go. Glimmer?",2,02
Swift Wind, Adora! Adora! Are you okay?,2,02
Adora, I don't know what I'm doing. I don't even know what this Watchtower is supposed to do or how it's supposed to help.,2,02
Swift Wind, If that's the case then why are you doing all of this anyway?,2,02
Adora," I need to be a better She-Ra than Mara. I need to know how to control my powers so I don't hurt people like she did. Light Hope is the only one that can teach me, and she's broken.",2,02
Swift Wind, You're really freaking out about this Mara thing aren't you?,2,02
Adora, How could I not? She ruined everything. And I don't know how to fix it.,2,02
Swift Wind," I'm sorry I didn't take this mission more seriously. The truth is, I'm just so excited to be your steed. I guess I just got carried away.",2,02
Adora," I'm sorry I dragged you into this with me. You were just a horse before I accidentally zapped you with my sword. If it we'rent for me, you would've been able to live out the rest of your days carefree in a nice pasture in Thaymore.",2,02
Swift Wind," Adora, I wouldn't trade my voice and my wings for anything. I've got the chance to change the world now. To make it better than when I found it. I can't imagine ever going back. Can you?",2,02
Adora, No. I don't think I can.,2,02
Bow, Glimmer!,2,02
Catra," Forget the princess, she's got no power! Get him!",2,02
Glimmer," I'm not as naive as you think. Turns out I saved a little magic, just for you! ",2,02
Scorpia, No!,2,02
Adora, Is this...?,2,02
Swift Wind, Our sacred bond?,2,02
Swift Wind, This is it. This is what I've been sensing. This is the epicenter.,2,02
Adora," She-Ra destroyed this place, now it's up to She-Ra to fix it. For the honor of Grayskull!",2,02
Swift Wind," Don't worry, I got this. Loop-de-loops!",2,02
She-Ra, Woo-hoo!  Wow!,2,02
Swift Wind, Not a bad team. Looks like we're getting the hang of this.,2,02
Light Hope, Then I will be back to operation... My sensors indicate they fixed it. Good.,2,02
Bow," At least we know for sure that Entrapta's alive, and working for the Horde, making weapons to wipe us out.",2,02
Adora," Hey guys. You'll never guess what Swift Wind and I did today. We restored a First Ones' Watchtower so Light Hope can balance the planet, and we brought a whole field back to life and... What happened to you?",2,02
Glimmer," Oh Adora, we've got a lot to catch you up on.",2,02
She-Ra,"  Ooh, okay. We need to find a way to reclaim the Horde-occupied fortress for The Rebellion. So how are we gonna do this?",2,04
Glimmer, I'll teleport ahead to scout out a path through their defenses.,2,04
Bow, And I'll quietly shoot the closest turrets with my trick-arrows. ,2,04
She-Ra, You'll have the advantage in a sneak-attack. ...Go!,2,04
Bow,  Yes! And now--,2,04
She-Ra,  He's...dead...,2,04
Bow,"  Oh, what?!  Tiny Bow, you will be avenged! ",2,04
Adora,  That clearly isn't going to work. Let's try this again. ,2,04
Bow,  I shouldn't be dead. That turret came out of nowhere...,2,04
Glimmer," That's because you failed to make a successful observation check. If we're going to retake the pass, we have to be prepared for anything.",2,04
Adora," The pass is the only way in or out of this region. According to the reports, the Horde seized it while we were busy defending Bright Moon,  so it's crucial that we get it back.",2,04
Bow,  Why does that mean I have to die? And after I made these for you.,2,04
Adora,"  Look, our plans always fall apart.  Always!  It would be impressive if it wasn't terrifying.",2,04
Glimmer,"  We have gotten really good at improvising, though.",2,04
Adora,"  If we're gonna pull this off, we need to come up with a plan that won't fall apart,  and a plan that takes into account everything the Horde could possibly throw at us, including surprise attacks.",2,04
Bow," Okay, but you're breaking Tiny Bow's heart.  I mean, look at his face!",2,04
Glimmer,  He's smiling.,2,04
Bow," Through his pain, Glimmer.  Through his pain!",2,04
Adora,"  Guys, this pass is important. The Horde is not going to give it up without a fight. It's obviously going to be guarded by their very best and brightest...",2,04
Scorpia,"  Move those big weapon-y things!  Flap those banners! Uh--keep doing whatever it is you're doing, guy I'm pointing at! Now do a different thing! And look sharp, Force Captain's orders!",2,04
Scorpia,  Catra left me in charge. Me. Can you believe it?!,2,04
Lonnie," Uh, no. I really can't.",2,04
Scorpia,"  Ah, me neither.  She must really trust me...  I can't let her down.  Kyle! Man the parapets!",2,04
Kyle,  I don't know what those are.,2,04
Scorpia,  Then find out!,2,04
Scorpia,"  ""Scorpia, you're in charge of the fortress,"" she said. ""Even you can't mess this up,"" she said.  Even me. She's thinking about me!  Ah...  Should I get her a 'Thank You' gift? What's her favorite color?  KYLE, what are you doing?!",2,04
Kyle,"  Uh, you said--I--",2,04
Scorpia,  Go find out Catra's favorite color!,2,04
Scorpia,"  Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey----you guys know Catra. W-what would she like? I need it to be something that says... 'Thank you', but also----'We are soulmates tied together by the beautiful threads of fate...'",2,04
Lonnie,"  We should spend less time talking about Catra, and more time talking about the defenses.",2,04
Lonnie,  The reason we're here!,2,04
Scorpia," Okay, you don't need to remind me. My wildcat is counting on me, and I won't  let her down.  For Catra, I will defend this pass with my very life!",2,04
Lonnie,  Wrong pass.,2,04
Scorpia,"  Yes, this is the pass I will defend with my very life. No reason to worry at all.",2,04
Adora," Clearly, that last plan won't work. So maybe, if we try sneaking past the turrets from a different side--",2,04
Glimmer,  You're going about this all wrong. We're not going to win by sneaking. We gotta take the action  to them!,2,04
Glimmer,  Just let Glimmer handle this.  Using my awesome powers of teleportation----I take out their first line of defense!,2,04
Glimmer,"  Then, I teleport over the wall and take out a line of soldiers with one CRITICAL strike! ",2,04
Glimmer," I back-flip, front-flip, back-flip into a teleport, poof! THEN, I take out a super-bot, and it EXPLODES!",2,04
Glimmer,"  And I'm past the wall----I'm unstoppable, I'M--",2,04
Bow," You ran out of teleports, like, 12 teleports ago.",2,04
Glimmer," Then, I land on you! ",2,04
Bow,  Tiny Bow! Nooooo! ,2,04
Adora,"  Glimmer, we need to come up with a plan based on reality.",2,04
Glimmer,"  Yes, and in that moment, I really would land on Bow.",2,04
Adora,"  Hmm. Using a limited number of teleports isn't a bad idea... So, Glimmer will take Bow--",2,04
Adora," --and, using her powers,  teleport him into the turrets' blind spot. Bow shall act as backup  while you and I breach the less-patrolled area up on the wall. ",2,04
Mermista, Uh...,2,04
Mermista, ...Why are you playing with dolls?,2,04
Adora,  We're not playing with dolls!,2,04
Bow,  Yeah! They're war-table battle figures--a-and I don't know if I have one for you. Hold on. ,2,04
Glimmer, Wait a minute. Aren't you supposed to be on watch?,2,04
Mermista,"  Oh, look, the fortress is still there, like it was an hour ago. Watch complete.",2,04
Mermista,"  Relax, I switched with Perfuma. ",2,04
Adora, We're still coming up with a plan.,2,04
Mermista, Am I in the plan?,2,04
Adora, We're getting to--,2,04
Bow," I don't have you, buuut I do have a seashell and a happy otter?",2,04
Mermista,"  Uhhh, googly eyes?  ...Pass.",2,04
Bow,  Wha--?!,2,04
Adora, Can we please get back to--,2,04
Mermista,  I'll be She-Ra.,2,04
Adora,  You can't be She-Ra. I'm She-Ra.,2,04
Mermista," Not anymore. Ya snooze, ya lose--",2,04
Mermista," Uh, wow, rude much?",2,04
Lonnie,  Alert Force Captain Scorpia. We've got a princess problem.,2,04
Glimmer,"  I admit, I got a little carried away. But the rest of my plan could work.",2,04
Glimmer,  And I've already thought of that.,2,04
Glimmer,  I knew destroying the bots would lure her out.,2,04
Glimmer's Catra,"  And so it has, Glimmer. ",2,04
She-Ra,  This is how you see Catra?,2,04
Bow,"  Yeah, this seems a little off.",2,04
She-Ra,  A little?,2,04
Glimmer's Catra," You fell into my trap. I've armed the tower with a bomb, capable of taking out my greatest enemy-- you.",2,04
Glimmer, Do you expect us to just sit here?!,2,04
Glimmer's Catra," No, princess, I expect you to di--",2,04
Perfuma, I cast Giant Flytrap on Catra!,2,04
Perfuma,"  Oops, sorry Bow.",2,04
Glimmer, Ugh! What are you doing here?,2,04
Frosta, Mermista said you were playing a battle game. We wanna join!,2,04
Adora,  We are in the middle of a very serious planning session.,2,04
Perfuma,  We have lots of ideas for plans!,2,04
Glimmer, Aren't you on watch right now?!,2,04
Adora,"  Okay, but only if you guys are serious about the--",2,04
Frosta,  I'm sitting next to Glimmer!,2,04
[The group converses in a cacophony; some things that are said include,,2,04
Bow, What does that flytrap normally eat?,2,04
Frosta," I have amazing ideas, starting with we PUNCH them!",2,04
Mermista, Anyone else hungry? I am hungry.],2,04
Scorpia," Spy Bot, the mission is simple, I need you to spy on the princesses so I can stop them, and impress Catra so much she'll finally admit we're best friends, or at the very least, we have a bond that can never be broken. You got that?",2,04
Lonnie," Uh, it's not turned on, and, um, that's not how it works.",2,04
Scorpia," Good, good! Yeah, I was just testing you on whether you knew how to do--that, and...you passed, so...kudos.",2,04
Scorpia,"  Now, let's go spy!",2,04
Scorpia,"  Aww, aren't you the cutest little fella! Look at you with your little legs and your antenna. You're just about the cutest thing I've ever----Spying. Yes. That is the thing...that we are. Doing.",2,04
Scorpia,  Second test...,2,04
Lonnie,  Do you want me to drive the Spy Bot?,2,04
Scorpia,"  Yes, please.",2,04
Bow," Okay, everyone has a figure, except Perfuma who's using her plant, and Mermista who has...that for some reason. ",2,04
Mermista, Says the guy with a bag of dolls.,2,04
Bow,  They're war-table battle figures!,2,04
Adora," Okay, so I'm thinking--",2,04
Bow," Hold on.  So far I have shot, eaten, and squashed. We're doing my plan. And there will be no death, no dying, just heroic good times.",2,04
Bow,"  I am Bow. She-Ra's best friend, and defender of Etheria.  When the evil Horde strikes, I strike back. ",2,04
Perfuma,"  Ooh, we all get hats!",2,04
Mermista,  Ugh...,2,04
Bow,"  After I destroy the turrets with my trick arrows, Glimmer teleports us to the tower.  There, someone waits in the shadows... ...Catra.",2,04
Bow's Catra,  Fools. I won't let you destroy my  purrrfect plan.,2,04
Adora,  What??,2,04
Glimmer,  This is kind of amazing...,2,04
Bow,"  It looks like I've got you meow, evil doer!",2,04
Bow's Catra, I'd paws to reflect on your upcoming death if I were mew.,2,04
Bow," I don't know, I'm feline pretty good right now.",2,04
Adora," Ooh, stop. You gotta stop.",2,04
Mermista,  Now we're all hoping this plan kills us.,2,04
Bow's Catra, Then  purrrr-pare to meet your end! ,2,04
Frosta,"  Wait, she can do that?!",2,04
Bow,"  No, but I-I ran out of figures and only have this left, so she can now.  ...Also, the Horde has dragons because I did not make enough robots.",2,04
Bow," Not to worry, I'll shoot her with my net arrow! ",2,04
Bow,"  Oh, come on!",2,04
Adora,"  She would obviously duck. You can't underestimate Catra or the Horde. ...Now, I think we can exploit a weakness in the wall--",2,04
Perfuma,  Is it my turn?,2,04
Adora,  This isn't a GAME.,2,04
Perfuma, I use my magic to grow a Plant Golem to take down the tower!,2,04
Bow," If it's made out of plants, how does it roar?",2,04
Perfuma,  It's plant magic!,2,04
Adora,"  Perfuma, we're not just making up whatever we want.",2,04
Mermista," Plus, your idea is dumb.",2,04
Perfuma,  And what would you do?,2,04
Mermista,"  Uh, I step forward and I say--",2,04
Mermista,"  I am Mermista. Fabulous secrets were revealed to me in the day that I held aloft my trident and said, ""For the Honor of Gray Whales!"" ",2,04
Mermista,"  Then it's like sparkle, sparkle, dolphin, sparkle.",2,04
Adora,  Mermista...,2,04
Mermista,"  I get shoes that are slightly better than my normal shoes, there's probably another dolphin...",2,04
Adora,  Mermista!,2,04
Mermista," Then, like, I twirl and my hair does this thing  where it looks all messy, but it's actually, like, really super-beautiful...",2,04
Adora,  You can't transform into She-Ra!,2,04
Mermista,"  Uh, duh, I'm Sea-Ra. Princess of the Oceans, obviously. ",2,04
Perfuma,"  No, i-i-if-if she gets to be Sea-Ra, I get to have a Plant Golem.",2,04
Frosta,  The Winter's Bane needs no help from a plant...,2,04
Adora,  The what?!,2,04
Frosta,"  My enemies know me as Frostbite Winter's Bane.  My friends call me Bane.  That is, if I had any. But no one comes close to the Winter's Bane!",2,04
Mermista,  What's that pink blob next to her?,2,04
Glimmer,  What?!,2,04
Adora,  We're getting so far from the real plan. Can we please focus?!,2,04
Glimmer, Yeah. Focus on how I'm not a sidekick!,2,04
Lonnie, We've got visual. Turning on the audio. ,2,04
Perfuma,  My army of Plant Golems will take down the tower instantly!,2,04
Frosta,  Frostbite uses Snowstrike to encase the tower in ice and then crack it apart...KAPOW!,2,04
Mermista," Uh, you mean Sea-Ra will use the Trident of Power to blow it up.",2,04
Glimmer,  You don't have a Trident of Power!,2,04
Mermista,"  Bow, make me a Trident of Power.",2,04
Bow,  I just don't wanna die again...,2,04
Scorpia,  I can't believe it...,2,04
Lonnie, Me either.,2,04
Scorpia,"  They're gonna give us frostbite, then attack us with a Plant Golem, and a woman named Sea-Ra?!  And Bow's got a Trident of Power?! Who knows what that does! Oh, we're doomed!",2,04
Lonnie,"  Ugh, they're obviously just coming up with ideas. Terrible ideas!",2,04
Scorpia, We cannot risk it.,2,04
Scorpia, Get in closer! ,2,04
Lonnie,  Hey! Get off of me!,2,04
"[Scene transition to the rebellion camp inside the tent; the robot beeps and whirs, beginning to make erratic movements; the cacophony of discussion in the tent can be heard to a degree",,2,04
Mermista,  Maybe we should throw Bow over the wall...,2,04
Bow,  Maybe we should throw everyone else over the wall!,2,04
Adora,  There goes taking this seriously! ],2,04
Scorpia," Nooo! Kyle, go grab one of the other Spy Bots you packed!",2,04
Kyle," Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Was that my job?",2,04
[They all disapprovingly say/gesture things including,,2,04
Scorpia," Really, Kyle? I don't know how you haven't been fired.",2,04
Lonnie, Kyle!,2,04
Rogelio,  ],2,04
Glimmer, I teleport in--,2,04
Adora, And run out of teleports.,2,04
Perfuma, My Plant Golem tears down the wall! ,2,04
Adora, The Horde will set it on fire.,2,04
Frosta, Frostbite smashes the wall! ,2,04
Adora, The ice armor cracks as soon as you hit stone.,2,04
Mermista, Sea-Ra destroy's the Horde bots! ,2,04
Adora,"  There is no Sea-Ra, and you guys aren't taking Catra into account!",2,04
Perfuma," Oh, sure we are, see?",2,04
Frosta," No, no, she's more like--",2,04
Frosta's Catra, ] I love ruining parties!,2,04
Glimmer, ,2,04
Glimmer's Catra,  I'm a monster!,2,04
Bow,  What a--,2,04
Bow's Catra, --purr-fectly evil group!,2,04
Adora,  None of this is right!,2,04
Glimmer,  We've been here for hours.  It's time we attack!,2,04
Adora,"  The Horde will counter whatever we throw at them. We're gonna go again, and we're not gonna leave until we have a perfect plan.",2,04
Bow," ...Adora, isn't this all going a little overboard? I mean, we've faced the Horde before. What's the worst that could happen?",2,04
Adora,"  You wanna know the worst that could happen? Fine. I'm the heaviest hitter, so Catra will separate me right away. Trap me, take my sword, do something so I'm helpless when she turns on you. She knows everything about me, exactly what I'll do, exactly how to take me out.  They'll overwhelm Frosta and Mermista with bots , they'll fire on Perfuma  and use her to draw Bow out into the open, pinning him down between the bots and the Horde soldiers. Glimmer will teleport in to save him, but she won't have enough magic left to get out, trapping them both.  Catra will make me watch all of it before she finishes me off, and then everyone is gone, and the Horde wins the war, and Etheria crumbles, and it's all my fault! ",2,04
Adora, The Horde nearly destroyed Etheria. We were barely able to stop it. If this plan isn't perfect... if I'm not perfect...everyone will--,2,04
Glimmer," Adora...I was captured by Shadow Weaver, taken to the Fright Zone, and lost my powers.",2,04
Bow,"  Glimmer, not helping...",2,04
Glimmer," But you know what? We escaped. I fought without my powers...and we won! Bad things are going to happen. That's life. You can let it paralyze you...or you can roll with it. Figure out the things you can...and, trust that your friends have your back for the rest.",2,04
Bow, You've got this Adora.,2,04
Perfuma, I cast friendship and support on my next turn.,2,04
Mermista," Here.  This is my Trident of Power. I want you to have it, especially since Bow is making me a new one.",2,04
Bow, I didn't agree to that!,2,04
Mermista, You will.,2,04
Frosta," The Winter's Bane stands with you! Also--me--Frosta--stands with you--I--can't tell if we're still in character, or not...",2,04
Adora,  Thank you.,2,04
Bow, So...What do we do now?,2,04
She-Ra,  Let's go.,2,04
Lonnie," We've added more bots to the tower's weak points. Kyle is...hiding somewhere, and Rogelio is commanding the extra turrets.",2,04
Scorpia,  A-And if there are plant monsters or warriors in ice armor or Sea-Ra--,2,04
Lonnie,"  For the last time, none of that stuff was real.  We've reinforced our defenses. We got this.",2,04
Scorpia,"  Okay. Good. Thanks, Lonnie. ...Who's Rogelio?",2,04
Lonnie,  Rogelio... The lizard guy...,2,04
Scorpia," Oh, right.  Yeah, I wondered what his deal was...",2,04
Lonnie,"  No...No, it can't be! ",2,04
Perfuma,  For the She-Ra! ,2,04
Scorpia,  F-f-fire!,2,04
Perfuma," Yay, Frosta!",2,04
Frosta,  This is...colder than I thought it would be.  But not a problem.  Snow...strike!,2,04
Frosta," Thanks, Mermista.",2,04
Mermista,"  You mean Sea-Ra, Princess of the Oceans! ",2,04
She-Ra,  Charge!,2,04
Mermista, I am Sea-Ra!,2,04
Perfuma,  Plant magic!,2,04
Frosta,  The Winter's Bane!,2,04
She-Ra," It's over, Catra. You've lost.",2,04
Scorpia, Catra's not here. But I'm happy to take you down for her. ,2,04
Bow,"  Whoo! Yeah, gotcha! ",2,04
Glimmer, Bow! ,2,04
She-Ra,  Catra's really not here? ...And she left you in charge?,2,04
Scorpia,  Yes! Why do people keep acting surprised about that?,2,04
Scorpia," Bup, bup, bup! You stay where you are. Or we'll find out if Sparkles here has enough magic to land on her feet.  Like I was saying, Catra trusts----OW! Hey!  You don't hit the person dangling you over the edge! Stop! ",2,04
She-Ra,  Glimmer? Are you okay?,2,04
Glimmer,"  How's that for improvising?  Also, it's your turn now because I'm completely out of magic.",2,04
Scorpia,"  Catra trusts--!  Catra--! Catra trusts--huh?!   Okay, seriously? How many of you are there?  Ohhh. ...Too many. ...Whoa! ",2,04
Bow,  That. Was. Awesome!,2,04
Glimmer,  Good planning session.,2,04
She-Ra,"  Thanks, guys.",2,04
Scorpia,  All in favor of blaming this on Kyle?,2,04
[At the same time,,2,04
Lonnie," Oh, yeah.",2,04
Rogelio, ,2,04
Scorpia," Yep. Yeah, that's unanimous. ]",2,04
Kyle,"  Oh, man.",2,04
Entrapta," Hi, Catra! Did you have a nice nap?",2,05
Catra,  Why is this taking so long? You said there was a First Ones weapon here. Where is it?,2,05
Entrapta," I never said ""weapon"", I said there's a piece of First Ones tech buried deep under the ice  and a really powerful one at that! With the energy levels we picked up, it must have been part of the First Ones supercomputer.",2,05
Catra,  Just...keep digging.  Hordak is not going to be happy if we waste his time and come back empty-handed.,2,05
Entrapta,  A scientist never returns empty-handed.  There's always data!,2,05
Catra,"  I'm not here freezing my tail off for data. Find me something useful, or we're packing up and heading home.  This place gives me the creeps.",2,05
Sea Hawk,"  The Dragon's Daughter Five! She cuts a fine line on the sea, does she not?",2,05
Bow," Wait, what happened to the Dragon's Daughter Four? ...Oh, oh, oh! Was it  adventure?",2,05
Sea Hawk,"  No. Termites. I couldn't save the old girl.  Anyway, I'm honored to be a part of another daring mission for the Rebellion!",2,05
She-Ra," Well, you know, we needed a boat to get up here, and you...have a boat.",2,05
Sea Hawk,"  Yes, I do!  Truth be told, I was...glad to have something to do. Mermista canceled our plans this week and she's hanging out with her other friends, and didn't invite me to join, I...",2,05
Glimmer,"  Well...let this mission distract you from all that. ...We've received reports of Horde activity from the Northern Reach. They've set up some kind of outpost, but we have no idea know why.",2,05
Bow, The Northern Reach is nothing but snow and ice. What could they possibly be doing?,2,05
She-Ra," I don't know, but it can't be good.",2,05
Scorpia,"  Okay, Scorpia, get your head in the game, alright? You've got this. You and Catra have a special bond, and deep down in her heart  she knows that.",2,05
Catra," Scorpia, good, you're here.",2,05
Scorpia," Yes, I am.",2,05
Catra,"  Entrapta brought all this junk from her lab. Help me find a space heater or something, since apparently, we live here now.",2,05
Scorpia,"  So, I've been thinking, and...I know you've been really busy and focused on your career, lately, but...would you...ever want to...you know, like ...hang out sometime? ...With me?",2,05
Catra,  What are you talking about? We are hanging out. Right now.,2,05
Scorpia," Yes. Totally. Totes. But uh, what I meant was  outside of office hours? You know we could  I don't know, umm...play a board game or...do some other type of bonding  activity? ",2,05
Entrapta,"  Aaah, careful with that! It's a rare First Ones artifact! I've been meaning to study it, but I haven't gotten the chance yet. The last time I deployed it, it ended up infecting my robots with some kind of...murder-virus.",2,05
Catra,"  You brought along a murder-virus, and not a blanket?",2,05
Entrapta,"  Oh, it does other things, too. For example, when it infected She-Ra, she lost her powers.  Also, she got very floppy.",2,05
Catra,"  A She-Ra off-switch, huh? Why didn't you say something sooner?",2,05
Scorpia," So, anyway, in non...She-Ra business,  when I said we could do something--",2,05
Entrapta, Uh-oh.,2,05
Catra,  What?,2,05
Entrapta,"  It's just a small bump. I'm sure it's fine, but...our drilling bots have gone offline. All of them. At once.  ....Come on! We should go check this out. ",2,05
Catra,  I hate this place. ,2,05
Sea Hawk,"  Come to think of it, Mermista never invites me to hang out with her other friends. I mean,  am I not cool enough, for them? I'm so cool. I'm Sea Hawk!",2,05
Glimmer,  What's wrong? Did you see something?,2,05
She-Ra," No, I think there's something else out here.",2,05
Sea Hawk,"  You know, they say all sorts of strange things happen in the Northern Reach. Voices in the wind. Monsters in the snow. Machines break down. Sailors disappear  without a trace.  We could be next!  ...I am cool, right? I am. Right?",2,05
Bow,  My tracker pad's been on the fritz ever since that rogue communications hub messed with it. I'm having trouble pinpointing the Horde's location.,2,05
Sea Hawk, Worry not. We'll follow our  instincts!  This way!,2,05
Bow," Or, there's this new signal, now. It's big. It looks like a First Ones tech signature.",2,05
She-Ra, That's where the Horde will be.,2,05
Entrapta,  Ah! Here we go. Well...the drilling bots are gone.,2,05
Scorpia,  What? They just disappeared into thin air?,2,05
Entrapta,  Maybe there's scientific truth about the rumors of strange happenings in this region...,2,05
Catra,"  We weren't sent here to chase rumors. Hordak wants  tech. If your bots can't dig it out, then maybe I'll send you down there to--",2,05
She-Ra,  Catra.,2,05
She-Ra, It's been awhile.,2,05
Catra,"  Hey, Adora.",2,05
She-Ra,  You're pretty far from the front line. I guess Shadow Weaver's keeping you away from the action since you lost the Battle of Bright Moon.,2,05
Catra,  Shadow Weaver?  Wow. I always forget how clueless you are.,2,05
She-Ra,  We're here to take back this land. It's time for you to go back to the Fright Zone.,2,05
Catra,  You want us to go?! Try and make us.,2,05
She-Ra, My pleasure.,2,05
Sea Hawk,  Adventure!,2,05
Scorpia,  This is not how this night was supposed to go!,2,05
Sea Hawk,"  Hey, while we're here, would you describe me as cool? Be honest, now.",2,05
Scorpia,  Potentially! ,2,05
Bow,  Entrapta! Whatever you're doing here has to stop! You don't understand the forces you're messing with!,2,05
Entrapta,  I know! That's the fun of it!,2,05
She-Ra,  Don't move!,2,05
Catra,"  Oh, please. You'd never have the guts.  You know, as much as I love our fights, it's way too cold for this. Why don't we try something new?! ",2,05
Glimmer,"  Catra, what did you do?!",2,05
Catra,  You said she'd be powerless.,2,05
Entrapta, She will be. Eventually. I think.,2,05
Catra," Actually, this is pretty cool.",2,05
Glimmer," I know you're still in there, Adora! You've got to snap out of it! Let go of the sword. You're gonna be okay, I promise!",2,05
Bow,  Glimmer! ,2,05
Sea Hawk,  What is happening?!,2,05
Catra,  This is the greatest thing that's ever happened.,2,05
Catra,  Adora! Wait!,2,05
Scorpia,  Stay away from her! ,2,05
Entrapta,"  Oh! I get it now! The sword got infected, not Adora herself. Huh. I guess she really is organic matter.",2,05
Scorpia,"  Catra, are you okay?!",2,05
Catra,"  That went so much better than I could've ever hoped.  Looks like you're mine now, Adora.  Come on, get her inside.",2,05
Bow,  Is everyone okay?,2,05
Sea Hawk,"  Well, I for one, am shocked and terrified. What happened up there?",2,05
Glimmer, It's Entrapta's disc. It infected She-Ra once before. We've got to get to Catra and destroy it for good.,2,05
Sea Hawk,"  Okay. Let's go, Glimmer. Teleport us up there.  Adventure!",2,05
Glimmer,"  I can't. I exhausted my magic in the fight. Until I can recharge, we're climbing.",2,05
Sea Hawk,"  Well, that's terribly inconvenient. Shouldn't you keep better count, or something?",2,05
Glimmer,  I hope Catra survives She-Ra so I can wipe that smirk off her face myself.,2,05
Catra,"  Always so perfect, look at you now. You're coming back to the Horde, under my command.",2,05
Scorpia," So we're, uh, keeping her...?",2,05
Catra," You saw her out there.  As long as we have this sword, we have the power to make her go berserk. We can turn the Rebellion's own hero against them. That's good.  I wonder which of your friends I'll have you annihilate first... ",2,05
Scorpia, ,2,05
Entrapta,  It looks like the bots were able to pinpoint the First Ones tech before they disappeared. If you just give me a little more time.,2,05
Catra,"  Ugh, hey. This dumb mission is over. We have what we need right here, the ultimate weapon. Pack up. We're taking her back to the Fright Zone.",2,05
Entrapta,  But...Hordak wanted us to--,2,05
Catra," Oh, wanted us to dig a useless hole for nothing? Forget it, I'm bringing She-Ra back.",2,05
Catra,"  I'll go. It's probably just more Rebel idiots. Scorpia, keep an eye on Adora.",2,05
Scorpia," Oh, yeah. Yeah. I will absolutely look after this sleeping, non-moving person.  Uh...",2,05
Entrapta,  She went that way.,2,05
Sea Hawk,"  I'm a pirate! Pirates are the definition of cool. Although, you would think that I'd get invited to more parties...I mean, you think I'm cool, right?",2,05
Sea Hawk," I'm Sea Hawk, I am, I am / Want to take a guy for granted, then I am your man  / Unappreciated in all I do, why can't they see, I'm very cool / Guys, back me up, I'm very cool!",2,05
Scorpia,"  Just wanted a moment alone with Catra, but, no, I'm stuck babysitting her ex-best friend.",2,05
Scorpia,"  Uh...you okay, there, Adora?",2,05
Adora,  Wow. You...are a big bug. ,2,05
Scorpia,"  Whew, yep. That is the truth. Glad you're seeing clearly. Now, come on.  I'm taking you back to the lab.  Aw, now what was the code again? ...Uh, maybe--",2,05
Scorpia, Stop that.,2,05
Scorpia," Okay, wait, I'm pretty sure it was--",2,05
Scorpia,"  Don't, don't! Stop! Why are you making this so much harder for me? Please.  Please! I'm a woman on the edge! I've had a real challenge of a day!",2,05
Scorpia,  How did you do that?,2,05
Adora,  I put in Catra's favorite number. ,2,05
Scorpia,"  Ugh, I get it. You know Catra's favorite number and I don't. Rub it in my face, why don't you?",2,05
Scorpia, Uh...that's not good.,2,05
Scorpia," Change of plans, how about we stay inside?",2,05
Adora,"  Yay, it's a girl's night in! ",2,05
Bow,  Any sign of She-Ra? Preferably the version of her that won't throw us off a cliff?,2,05
Glimmer,"  Uh, no...no She-Ra...Just a terrifying snow monster!",2,05
Scorpia,"  Can't believe I'm stuck in a closet here with you. I should be by Catra's side, protecting her. Why can't you just stay out of our way? ",2,05
Scorpia,  Catra?  ...Inspector Pirate? ,2,05
Sea Hawk,  Adora!  I'm here to rescue you!,2,05
Adora, Uh...more like I'm here to rescue you. ,2,05
Sea Hawk, That doesn't make any sense. Is she all right?,2,05
Scorpia," I don't know, but she is getting on my last nerve, and she is not going anywhere.",2,05
Sea Hawk, We'll see about that! En garde!,2,05
Adora,  Aw...you guys are my best friends!,2,05
Catra,  I really hate this place... ,2,05
Catra,  What's happening? Why is the power going out?,2,05
Entrapta,"  Apparently, by drilling into the ice, we've unleashed these creatures and now they're obsessively trying to destroy us.  What an unexpected twist! ",2,05
Glimmer,  Where did these things come from?!,2,05
Bow,  I'm guessing it's something to do with that giant pit Entrapta dug.,2,05
Glimmer,"  Bow, their eyes! They're red, just like She-Ra's! Do you think...maybe the monster's have been infected, too.  UGH! Catra is the worst!",2,05
Bow,"  Uh, think you have one teleport left?",2,05
Glimmer,  Hope so!,2,05
Entrapta,  Hi!,2,05
Entrapta,  Fascinating...,2,05
Sea Hawk,  Hand. Her. Over!,2,05
Scorpia,"  Let go! Catra entrusted me with watching her, I can't let her down.",2,05
Adora, Catra...  She's mean...,2,05
Scorpia,"  She's misunderstood! You of all people should know that! I mean, you grew up together...  I can't compete with that.  No matter what I do, I can't seem to break down her walls.  But you two... even when you're trying to kill each other, you can tell there's a real bond there. I just... I wish she would see me as being worth her time, too.",2,05
Sea Hawk,  I-- I know how you feel. ,2,05
Catra," Always great to see you, Sparkles, but we're a little busy here!",2,05
Glimmer," Where's the disc, Catra?",2,05
Catra," What, you didn't like my new, improved version of She-Ra?",2,05
Bow,"  Whatever the Horde is giving you, it's not worth the damage you're doing to Etheria. Those monsters outside are infected by the same virus that's infecting She-Ra! ",2,05
Entrapta," Infected? That can't be right. The disc only infects First Ones tech, unless-- the bugs are First Ones tech! ",2,05
Sea Hawk," I mean, just once I'd like to hang out with Mermista and her friends. I'm good at groups! I have excellent stories of derring-do! Why don't they want me around? ",2,05
Scorpia,"  Oh, I hear ya. Catra's been so busy since she got promoted, but she still always expects me to make time for her. Does she even understand how much I do for her?!",2,05
Sea Hawk," Exactly! It seems like...the only time anyone wants to hang is when they need me to give them a ride, or do something for them.",2,05
Scorpia,"  Ugh, tell me about it. Catra once used my rock hard exoskeleton as a nail file.  I even had to buff!",2,05
Scorpia,  Is there...something wrong with us?,2,05
Adora,"  You know...you guys are really great. You're just, like, the best. You're good friends, and good people.  And I like you... You are so pointy! ",2,05
Sea Hawk," You know what? She's right. We are really great.  I'm clever, roguishly good-looking, and a top-notch sailor.  I don't care if anyone else thinks I'm cool. I don't need their opinions to validate me.  I'm Sea Hawk!",2,05
Scorpia,"  And me? I am brave, strong,  give great hugs, and I'm loyal.  You may have left Catra, but someday, she's gonna see that I won't.  I'll always be there for her, because that's who I am!",2,05
Adora,  Yayyy!,2,05
Scorpia,  And I'm also someone who's about to go kick some bug butt!,2,05
Sea Hawk,  Let's show them what we're made of!,2,05
Glimmer,"  We have to destroy the disc, or none of us are getting out of here!",2,05
Catra,  Huh. Guess I must've lost it.,2,05
Entrapta,"  Oh, Catra, it's in your pocket, remember?",2,05
Scorpia,  For the Horde!,2,05
Sea Hawk,"  I don't agree with that sentiment, but I'm also here!",2,05
Adora,"  Pew, pew-pew!",2,05
Adora,"  Heyy, I know you.",2,05
Glimmer,  Adora! I'm so glad you're okay. ,2,05
Scorpia,"  Catra, are you all right?",2,05
Catra,  Just find the sword. I've got Adora!,2,05
Scorpia," Oh, no you don't!",2,05
Adora,  Hiii....,2,05
Sea Hawk,  En garde!,2,05
Glimmer,  Just. Give. Us. The. Disc!,2,05
Catra, Are you kidding? I've got control of Adora. I am not giving that up.,2,05
Bow," Catra, you have to destroy the disc. It's the only way to stop them!",2,05
Scorpia,  Catra!,2,05
Glimmer," Scorpia, you can end this. You've got to break the disc now!",2,05
Catra,  Don't. You. Dare!,2,05
Scorpia,  Uh....uh...,2,05
Sea Hawk,  It seems to me that caring about someone is the greatest adventure of them all.,2,05
Scorpia,"  Sorry, Wildcat. This...is for your own good.",2,05
Catra,  NO!,2,05
Adora,  Oh...What happened?,2,05
Catra,  Hey! Put me down! ,2,05
Catra,  What are you so happy about? She-Ra won and we didn't get what we came for. The mission was a failure.  How are we going to explain this one to Hordak?,2,05
Entrapta, Failure? This mission was a resounding success.  Ta-daaa! I got the First Ones tech!,2,05
Catra,  What? When did you even--How long have you had that?!,2,05
Entrapta," A while. But we were having so much fun, I didn't want to say anything. Isn't it amazing? This puppy'll be able to power Hordak's portal technology and then some!  Hordak is gonna be so thrilled! ",2,05
Catra,  Hey. Thanks for getting us out of there.,2,05
Scorpia, Any time. ,2,05
Catra,"  All right, come on. ",2,05
Scorpia,"  Really?! Yes!  Thank you!  ...Oh, gosh. Look at us. Just...two peas in a pod.  So when I brought it up before I said board games, but  I mean, it doesn't have to be board games, we could do anything, I mean, I'm open. I-I like a-ah, bowling, ah, it's very difficult for me with my claws, but...",2,05
Catra,  Pull the switch! And let’s end this.,3,05
Adora,"  Catra… Please, don’t. No!",3,05
Catra,  Adora…,3,05
Catra, Adora!,3,05
Catra," Whoa, whoa, whoa! A-Adora! Heh. Since when do you sleep in?",3,05
Adora, Where am I? How did I get here?,3,05
Catra," Uh, you’re in your room. Are you okay?",3,05
Adora, I… I’m fine. I was just having a weird dream. There was something I needed to fix…,3,05
Catra," Of course you dream about work. There’s nothing to fix, Adora. Everything’s perfect.",3,05
Adora, Yeah…it was just a dream.,3,05
Catra," Come on, get up.",3,05
Catra,  Adora…,3,05
Horde Soldiers, Adora… It’s really her! It’s Adora!,3,05
Horde Soldiers, Whoo! Yeah! All right! Yes!,3,05
Adora, What are they all looking at?,3,05
Catra, You! The invasion of Thaymor went perfectly. You’re the hero of the hour.,3,05
Adora, Thaymor…,3,05
Adora, Oh…Yeah! I defeated the rebel insurgents at Thaymor. Yeah.  I did that.,3,05
Catra," Oh, please, you couldn’t have done it without me.",3,05
Adora, Right… What would I ever do without you?,3,05
Horde Soldier," Hey. Watch where you’re going, twerp.  Force Captain! I didn’t know you were-- I’m so sorry.",3,05
Adora, You’d better be. Dismissed.,3,05
Catra, Oh! Force Captain! Don’t hurt me! ,3,05
Catra, Too good!,3,05
Adora, Where are we going again?,3,05
Catra, To the locker room. There’s something I wanna show you.,3,05
Adora, Then why are we going the long way around? Let’s take the side door right—Huh.,3,05
Catra, What? It’s always been this way. Are you sure you’re okay?,3,05
Adora," Yeah, I’m okay.",3,05
Catra,"  Do you have a concussion or something? I know you get hit on the head a lot, but I figured your dumb little hair poof would cushion the blow.",3,05
Adora," I’m fine, okay? Don’t make me kick your butt!",3,05
Catra," Pfft, as if you could.",3,05
Lonnie,  Surprise!,3,05
Rogelio, ,3,05
Kyle, Surprise.,3,05
Adora, What is this? Are those ration bars?,3,05
Lonnie," We wouldn’t have been able to defeat the rebels at Thaymor without you. Plus, you were the one who talked Shadow Weaver into letting us come. So, we all pitched in, took Kyle’s ration bars for a week, and made this.",3,05
Kyle," I’m hungry, but celebrating your victory is worth it.",3,05
Adora," You guys! You even got the gray kind, it’s way better than the brown kind.",3,05
Lonnie," Hey, it was Catra’s idea!",3,05
Adora," Oh, yeah?",3,05
Catra," Eh, whatever, don’t make a big deal about it.",3,05
Adora," Wow, I can’t believe you like me, that is so embarrassing for you. ",3,05
Catra," Ow! Ugh, stop it! Get off! This is not because I like you!",3,05
Kyle,"  No. No, no, no! ",3,05
Lonnie,"  Oh, come on, Kyle!",3,05
Kyle, Sorry…,3,05
Kyle, Dang it…,3,05
Adora, What?,3,05
Catra, Hang on. You got something riiiiight…there! ,3,05
Shadow Weaver, Adora.,3,05
Shadow Weaver, Get off the floor. You are the Force Captain who sacked Thaymor.,3,05
Adora," Sorry, Shadow Weaver.",3,05
Shadow Weaver, And you…,3,05
Shadow Weaver, Look at you. You’re a mess. Go get yourself cleaned up.,3,05
Catra," Yes, Shadow Weaver.",3,05
Shadow Weaver," Adora, come with me.",3,05
Shadow Weaver," I will admit, I did not think that Catra and the others were ready to be deployed. But under your command, they performed admirably. You are becoming every bit the leader I always knew you to be.",3,05
Adora," Thank you, Shadow Weaver. I couldn’t have done it without them.",3,05
Shadow Weaver," Suffice it to say, Hordak is impressed with your performance. He is rewarding you with a new mission.",3,05
Adora, Really?,3,05
Shadow Weaver," You’ll get the rest of the details at briefing. Look at it, Adora. This is who you are. The Force Captain who will lead the Horde to victory.",3,05
Shadow Weaver, It’s what you’ve always dreamed of. Everything is perfect.,3,05
Madame Razz,"  Mara, dearie!",3,05
Adora, What did you just say?,3,05
Shadow Weaver," I said, are you ready for the briefing, Adora? Now run along. Don’t keep the sergeant waiting.",3,05
Scorpia, Hi. I’m Scorpia.,3,05
Adora," Oh, hey. Adora.",3,05
Scorpia," You know, I don’t know what it is, but I do not like you. I-It’s just like this gut feeling I have. Maybe it’s that little poof thing you do with your hair. Or how much it draws attention to your gigantic forehead.",3,05
Adora,"  Okay, can everyone lay off my hair today?",3,05
Scorpia," And what kind of name is “Adora”, anyway? It’s like, okay, I get it, everyone loves you. But I do not.",3,05
Sergeant," Now, it’s possible that you might have to go face-to-face with a Princess.  They’re powerful and completely devoid of conscience.  But it’s possible to take them out.",3,05
Razz,  What happened to the stars?,3,05
Adora,  What’s going on?!,3,05
Sergeant," Uh, Force Captain Adora? You have something to say?",3,05
Adora, Huh? Where’s the screen?,3,05
Sergeant, There’s…no screen. All the information should be in your report.,3,05
Sergeant, Force Captain!,3,05
Catra, Adora? Adora!  What is wrong?,3,05
Adora, Did you write this?,3,05
Catra, Did I write a blank piece of paper? I’m gonna go with no.,3,05
Adora," No, there was something—Something there, I—I think. And then I was running. Why was I running?",3,05
Catra," Okay, okay, calm down.",3,05
Adora," I can’t calm down. There’s something I keep forgetting, there’s something I-I’m supposed to fix. I remember a sword, a b-bright light, and you were there—",3,05
Adora, Ow! What was that?,3,05
Catra, Sorry! You were freaking out and it was freaking me out!,3,05
Adora," Well, you didn’t have to slap me!",3,05
Catra," Come on, let’s get you outside, you need some air.",3,05
Adora," No, Catra, I don’t need—",3,05
Adora, --Air…  How did we get here?,3,05
Catra, We climbed up…like we always do. Don’t you remember?,3,05
Adora, I don’t know what’s happening to me. It’s like I’m losing my mind.,3,05
Catra, You just need to relax.,3,05
Adora," Yeah… Yeah, you’re probably right. I’m--I’m fine. Everything’s fine.",3,05
Catra,"  Of course I’m right. Everything’s perfect. Soon, the two of us are gonna be ruling Etheria together, just like we always planned.",3,05
Adora, Is that what you really want? To rule the world?,3,05
Catra," I—I mean, yeah, obviously… Isn’t that what you want, too?",3,05
Adora, I don’t know.,3,05
Catra, Don’t flake out on me now. This is what we always wanted. Everything will be perfect as long as we stay together.,3,05
Adora, What if we don’t stay together? What if it all goes wrong?,3,05
Adora, Why can’t you see that?!,3,05
Catra," Adora! Stay with me, okay? You’re just seeing things. It’s all in your head.",3,05
Lonnie,  Adora! Catra! Thought we’d find you up there. Get down here! We got big news.,3,05
Adora, …What?,3,05
Lonnie," Okay, okay. We just got word, we’re being sent to Salineas tonight.",3,05
Adora, But they said at the briefing that’s not for another week.,3,05
Lonnie, Adora? It’s been a week.,3,05
Adora, No. ,3,05
Catra, Adora?,3,05
Adora," I know this is wrong, can’t you see it?! My memories don’t match, we’re jumping around, things are disappearing, it’s like time and space aren’t working right. And I— ",3,05
Catra," Adora, stop it.  Stop!",3,05
Adora, Mara! Portal. I think I remember. None of this is right.  We’re not supposed to be here.,3,05
Catra, Adora! Everything’s okay.,3,05
Adora," Stop saying that! This isn’t right! Everyone keeps telling me everything is perfect, but it’s not. …Everyone except Scorpia.",3,05
Catra," Adora! Adora, where are you going?",3,05
Adora, You don’t think things are perfect!,3,05
Scorpia," Whoa! Ever hear of personal space? I happen to take it very seriously. And also, …what are you talking about?",3,05
Adora," Things aren’t right! You must feel it, too. I’m not sure why yet, but I’m starting to remember. …I need to get into Hordak’s sanctum and you need to help me!",3,05
Scorpia," Hordak’s sanctum.  I’m not sure if you know, but no one is allowed in there without express permission. I mean , this is basic stuff. Are you sure you’re qualified to be a Force Captain?",3,05
Adora," All of my memories stop in Hordak’s sanctum. There’s something in there…something powerful and dangerous, and that’s where it all started. That’s where I have to go to fix things!",3,05
Scorpia," Okay, Adora, I totally hear you. Everything’s gonna be fine.  In fact, I think I know some nice people who can help if you just—",3,05
Adora,"  Scorpia, you have to remember something. Tell me you remember. Everyone’s acting like things are perfect, except for you… Even Catra is—",3,05
Scorpia, Catra… ,3,05
Adora, You do remember…,3,05
Scorpia," No, I— I mean, I-I don’t know. And Catra she—she was just scared, she didn’t mean to—What is going on? I keep-I keep forgetting things. This… This is all wrong. How did we get here?",3,05
Adora, I don’t know. All I know is that we have to get to Hordak’s sanctum. ,3,05
Scorpia, HOW DID WE GET HERE?,3,05
Adora," Just go with it, okay? We need to get past those guards.",3,05
Scorpia," Oh, man, this is a bad plan! What happens if we get caught? We are so fired!",3,05
Scorpia," Enough, stop it.  Don’t, just—just move, move.",3,05
Horde soldier, Hey! What are you doing here? Hands up!,3,05
Scorpia,  Did I just do that?! I am so fired.,3,05
Adora, Scorpia. You need to focus. None of that matters.,3,05
Scorpia, I don’t like this.,3,05
Scorpia," Uh, wasn’t there a door here just a second ago?",3,05
Adora,"  Things are disappearing. It’s getting worse. We have to hurry, there’s-there’s gotta be another way in. …There! It’s that lady!",3,05
Scorpia, What lady?,3,05
Adora, The one who says “Mara.” Come on!,3,05
Scorpia," Okay, that makes no sense! But I’m gonna follow you because I don’t see a lot of other options.",3,05
Adora, Wait!,3,05
Scorpia,"  Oh, she’s so fast. …Okay. ",3,05
Scorpia,  Why… is everyone… so… fast? Whoa.,3,05
Adora, This is it. Come on.,3,05
Scorpia, I hope this works.,3,05
Adora, It will. And then you can go back to hating me.,3,05
Scorpia," Look. If you get us out of this, I promise I won’t hate you. I will just dislike you a reasonable amount.",3,05
Adora, Deal.,3,05
Adora," No. No, no…",3,05
Adora," This can’t be right. It was here, it was right here. Where is it?! ",3,05
Adora," Catra. It was Catra. Catra did this, she captured me, she took-- …the sword. She activated the portal.",3,05
Scorpia, Sword?,3,05
Adora," The sword. There’s supposed to be a sword. My sword. But it’s gone. It’s in the portal! That’s why we’re here, I need to find it!",3,05
Scorpia,"  Quick, hide!",3,05
Scorpia, That was close.,3,05
Adora, Run!,3,05
Scorpia," What is happening?! I don’t understand what is going on! Adora, wait! Wait up! ",3,05
Adora,  Scorpia? Scorpia!,3,05
Adora, Wait!,3,05
Razz," Why, hello, Mara, dearie!",3,05
Adora, Who are you? Why do I know you? What are you doing in the Fright Zone? Is this real?,3,05
Razz," I am afraid so, dearie. But you can still fix it. There’s still time!",3,05
Razz," Find me in the woods, dearie!",3,05
Lonnie," Adora! Adora, where have you been?!",3,05
Adora," Lonnie, we have to get out of here. Where are Kyle and Rogelio?",3,05
Lonnie, Who?,3,05
Adora, Our…teammates since we were kids. Where are they?,3,05
Lonnie, Uh…I don’t remember… I think… I think they’re gone?  What is going on?!,3,05
Adora, Come on!,3,05
Adora," Lonnie, we have to… ",3,05
Adora, Catra!,3,05
Catra, Adora—,3,05
Catra," Hey! You’ve officially lost it, haven’t you?!",3,05
Adora," Listen, we have to go. Now! Scorpia, Lonnie, Kyle, Rogelio, they’re all gone.",3,05
Catra, What are you talking about? Who’s gone?,3,05
Adora, They’re gone! There’s nothing left. And we’ll be next if we don’t get out of here right now.,3,05
Catra,"  You’re not making any sense. Everything’s fine, okay? It’s--",3,05
Adora," Don’t say it’s perfect! I know it’s not perfect, and so do you!",3,05
Catra, You’ve gone crazy. I’m not going anywhere.,3,05
Adora, Catra…,3,05
Catra, What are you--?! ,3,05
Adora,"  Catra, no!",3,05
Adora," Catra, you can’t. We need to get as far from the Fright Zone as possible or we’ll be completely erased along with everything else.",3,05
Catra,  You think you can convince me by kidnapping me?! What is wrong with you?,3,05
Adora, I won’t leave you behind again.,3,05
Catra, Why can’t you just stay? We have everything we ever wanted.,3,05
Adora," It’s not real, Catra. As much as I wish that things could be simple the way they used to be, there’s no going back.",3,05
Adora, Why did you do it?,3,05
Catra, I don’t know what you’re talking about!,3,05
Adora, There’s no time. We have to go.,3,05
Young Adora, You look out for me and I look out for you. Nothing really bad can happen as long as we have each other.,3,05
Young Catra, You promise?,3,05
Young Adora, I-,3,05
Adora,  I promise. Everything will be okay if we just stay together.,3,05
Past Adora, Come with me. You don’t have to go back there. We can fix this.,3,05
Adora, Help me fix this. Please!,3,05
Adora, This can’t be what you wanted!,3,05
Catra, Don’t you get it?! I am never going to go with you!,3,05
Catra," You always have to go and ruin it, don’t you?",3,05
Adora," Catra, look what’s happening! You’re going to destroy everything!",3,05
Catra, I don’t care. I won’t let you win. I’d rather see the whole world end than let that happen.,3,05
Adora," Catra, no!",3,05
Adora, Catra!,3,05
Razz," Oh, is that you, Mara?  You made it after all.",3,05
Adora, Madame Razz.,3,05
Razz," It’s been such a long time since we last saw each other, hasn’t it? That or…it hasn’t happened yet. I always get those two things mixed up.",3,05
Adora, I couldn’t save anyone else.,3,05
Razz," It’s not too late. You can still bring them back, but you must act quickly.",3,05
Adora, How do you know all of this?!,3,05
Razz," Because this has all happened before! I remember it like it was yesterday. For Madame Razz, it was yesterday…",3,05
Adora, This happened before…with Mara!,3,05
Razz," Yes, dearie. When she moved Etheria and took away the stars. Heh, it was crazy.",3,05
Adora, It’s all my fault. I’ve been so afraid of becoming another Mara. Destroying the world the way she did…and now…it’s happening.,3,05
Razz," Destroy the world?  No. Mara saved the world, and so will you. But you can’t waste any more time. You need to go back to the beginning. You need to find the sword. That is the only way this will stop!",3,05
Adora," I did that, didn’t I? I went back to the Fright Zone. The portal wasn’t there!",3,05
Razz," No, that wasn’t the beginning. You need to go back to the very beginning.",3,05
Adora, I-I-I don’t understand.,3,05
Razz," That’s all right, dearie. You don’t need to understand. You just need to remember.",3,05
Adora, I have to remember…,3,05
Adora,  Bow and Glimmer. I need to find them!,3,05
Razz," Go on, dearie! Quickly!",3,05
Castaspella," Glimmer, come at once. We need you in the War Room right away! There's no time to waste. You must make a decision.",4,01
Adora, We're here for you.,4,01
Glimmer, That one!,4,01
Castaspella," The Future Queen has spoken. At Glimmer's coronation, we will be serving – ice cream cake!",4,01
Glimmer, People are starting to arrive. I can't believe this is really my coronation day. Me. Queen Glimmer. Ugh. It sounds so weird.,4,01
Bow," Queen Glimmer. Queen Glimmer. Queen Glimmer! Yeah, that's going to take some getting used to.",4,01
Glimmer, I just... never thought it would actually happen.,4,01
Adora, Hey don't worry. You've got me and Bow beside you all the way. We'll make sure this day is perfect.,4,01
Glimmer," Yeah, you're right. We've got this. Do I look okay?",4,01
Adora, Like a queen.,4,01
Castaspella, Here you all are! What are you standing around for? The guests are starting to arrive! Come on! There's so much to do!,4,01
Adora, I'm worried about Glimmer.,4,01
Bow, Must be hard celebrating with Angella being gone.,4,01
Adora, It's her coronation. This should be a perfect day for Glimmer. We'll make it perfect. All we have to do is keep her mind off –,4,01
Bow, Angella?,4,01
Adora," Off everything, yes. Now come on!",4,01
Castaspella," So, the ceremony begins with the Ritual Quest, followed by your first speech as queen and most importantly, the whole thing ends with a Grand Ball!",4,01
Adora,"  Oh, there's a quest! We're great at quests.",4,01
Castaspella," Yes, the Quest of Queens, in which Glimmer will forge her connection to the Moonstone. The Moonstone's power has been balanced between you and your mother since you were born, but now, with her... her absent...",4,01
Bow," So, about that quest! We're great at quests, right guys?",4,01
Castaspella," Yes, it's all in the scrolls. Secret ritual, witnesses, light, etcetera, etcetera.",4,01
Castaspella," Oh, and you'll need this.  Are those the flower arrangements? Glimmer, what do you think?",4,01
Glimmer," Oh, uh, they're, uh, fine?",4,01
Castaspella," You're right, they're awful! Burn them at once. Also, you're fired.",4,01
Glimmer," Aunt Casta, you don't ...",4,01
Castaspella," Don't you worry about a thing. In addition to being a powerful sorceress, I am also a legendary party-planner. This will be a coronation for the ages! Glimmer, take us to the terrace!",4,01
Castaspella," Oh, we're-- We're walking, are we? Great. We can use the exercise.",4,01
Frosta, What do you think? I wanted to do something special for you.,4,01
Glimmer, This is going to be awful.,4,01
Frosta," Awful inspiring, right? I can make more!",4,01
Glimmer," I appreciate the idea. But I need someone for a very important job to, uh, greet the guests.",4,01
Frosta," Oh, you need a bouncer! I'm on it! Bouncer!",4,01
Glimmer," Wait, I didn't say bouncer. Okay.",4,01
Castaspella, Glimmer! I need your opinion on color schemes.,4,01
Glimmer, Uh...blue? What about purple?,4,01
Castaspella," Excellent choice. Isn't this fun? Soon you will have to make many decisions, just like your mother... That is, uh-- Chop, chop, everyone! Adora, move the ice sculpture to the side! We still need flower arrangements! Where is that florist?",4,01
Glimmer, You fired him.,4,01
Castaspella," Oh, right. Perhaps you'd like to do the flowers, Glimmer?",4,01
Glimmer, Uhhh,4,01
Bow, Hmm. ,4,01
Glimmer," you know, I bet Mermista would love to do the flowers! Right Mermista?",4,01
Mermista," Wow, how did you know? Flower arranging is my passion.",4,01
Castaspella, Ah! Wonderful! Now let's talk stem length.,4,01
Perfuma,  What? No! Why?,4,01
Swift Wind," Is now a good time to talk about my song for the coronation? I will require a stage, and oats for the backup horses.",4,01
Frosta, Stop bothering Glimmer! Bouncer!,4,01
Adora," Hey! I think it's all really coming together, don't you?",4,01
Adora," yep, it's gonna be perfect! What else we need to do, Bow?",4,01
Bow, Still don't know what the lantern is for! This is all so official and confusing. And it says Glimmer needs to wear some ceremonial robe. But I don't know where to get that!,4,01
Glimmer, Maybe if we all looked together--,4,01
Adora, Don't worry! We will find it!,4,01
Glimmer, But –,4,01
Adora, The two of us will find it for you.,4,01
Castaspella," Glimmer, you're needed in the Dining Room at once to choose the napkin folding technique! I'm thinking swans, what do you think?",4,01
Glimmer, Uh...I...,4,01
Castaspella," You're right, it's a terrible idea. I should just fire myself.",4,01
Glimmer," Aunt Casta, no –",4,01
Castaspella, Mermista! Vases!,4,01
Mermista, Don't stifle my creativity!,4,01
Castaspella, Uhg. Please.,4,01
Adora," It's okay, we will handle everything. You go have fun!",4,01
Glimmer, Fun. Right.,4,01
Catra, Hordak. Our troops are just sitting around. What are we waiting for? We need to talk about plans for--,4,01
Hordak, Plans?  Your last plan was to set off the portal machine before it was ready. Do you remember how that ended?,4,01
Catra," Whatever. It worked out for us, didn't it? The Rebellion's a mess. Their queen is gone. Now's our chance to gain the upper hand.",4,01
Hordak, And how are we going to do that when you couldn't even prevent the Rebellion from infiltrating the Fright Zone?,4,01
Catra," Yeah, like I said before, it was Entrapta who--",4,01
Hordak," I told you never to mention that name in my presence! If you are so desperate for a task, redouble our defenses so that no Princess can ever set foot in the Fright Zone again. Fortunately for you, my signal to Horde Prime went through.",4,01
Catra, Great so--,4,01
Hordak, That's the only reason you're here instead of facing punishment for your failure. Now get out!,4,01
Bow," Well, it took some searching, but we finally found the Royal Coronation Robe!",4,01
Adora," Wow, Glimmer! You look... Um",4,01
Castaspella," Oh, my little Glimmer. I'm so proud of you. I know you're going to make such a wonderful queen. Well, almost time for your quest! Give me a tick and this robe will fit like a dream!",4,01
Glimmer," Of course. The quest we still don't know anything about. But it'll be fine. Castaspella will fix the robe, Bow has the lantern, and I'll have you guys by my side the whole way. Right?",4,01
Bow," Umm... Right! Hey, um, Adora, can I talk to you real quick? I don't know where the lantern is! Glimmer can't do the quest without it, and she can't be queen without the quest! I've doomed the entire kingdom!",4,01
Adora," Bow, calm down! We just have to find the lantern, and Glimmer will be none the wiser. It has to be around here somewhere, right? This day is going to be perfect!",4,01
Shadow Weaver," There's no need to be alarmed. I'm a guest now. Can't you tell? Please, convey my best wishes to our new queen. I hope you two are till close. Power changes people.",4,01
Adora," Glimmer is a good friend. She'll be a good queen, too.",4,01
Shadow Weaver," Hmm. I hope for your sake, you're right.",4,01
Frosta," Adora, I've been freezing anyone trying to sneak in, but I'm running out of space to put them.",4,01
Adora, Unfreeze him right now!,4,01
Perfuma," Hmmm! Mermista, um, flowers are sort of my thing.",4,01
Mermista," Uh, it's art and it's what Glimmer wants. New queen, new era.",4,01
Frosta, Stop fighting! You're ruining Glimmer's big day! Bouncer!,4,01
Bow," Okay, has anyone seen a sacred lantern?",4,01
Mermista, Yeah. There.,4,01
Adora," Oh! We've been looking all over for it! Thanks, Swifty.",4,01
Swift Wind," And I'll present it to Queen Glimmer. And she'll be all, 'Swift Wind, why don't you sing the coronation song you made up?”",4,01
Swift Wind, Queen Glimmer – It's your day – we're all excited for you -,4,01
Mermista," Glimmer, can you please tell Perfuma to stop questioning your wise judgment?",4,01
Glimmer, What? I'm not--,4,01
Frosta, Where do you keep the blankets? Sea Hawk is whining about being frozen.,4,01
Glimmer, Why did you free...?,4,01
Castaspella," Glimmer, the quest is due to begin. Where's the lantern?",4,01
Swift Wind," I have it! And now, my song!",4,01
Perfuma, Everyone knows Glimmer would be happier with me on flowers!,4,01
Mermista, Glimmer obviously disagrees.,4,01
Castaspella," Glimmer, your guests are waiting.",4,01
Frosta," Everyone, stop bothering Glimmer. She has a ton on her plate...",4,01
Glimmer," Everyone, just stop!",4,01
Castaspella," Glimmer, we will fix all of this.",4,01
Glimmer, Let's just get this over with.,4,01
Catra, What are you doing in here?,4,01
Scorpia," Oh, uh--",4,01
Catra, You heard Hordak. He wants all this junk disposed of as soon as possible.,4,01
Scorpia," Hey, so, I know you made a heat of the moment decision which I totally get, but, um, you didn't really want Entrapta to stay on Beast Island forever. Anyway, I was thinking we cold go back and get her? I mean, she is our friend.",4,01
Catra," Entrapta betrayed us, and got what she deserved.",4,01
Scorpia," But she didn't betray us. She wanted to save us from the portal. And she was right, if Adora hadn't shut it down--",4,01
Catra," Entrapta betrayed Hordak. As for the portal, it left the Rebellion in shambles, and that means it worked. Got it? Good. Now, get this place cleared out.",4,01
Scorpia, It's okay. You can come out.,4,01
Scorpia," Hey there, Emily. Don't worry. I won't let anything happen to you.",4,01
Castaspella," We are gathered here today to witness the crowning of Queen Glimmer of Bright Moon as she completes the Quest of Queens and begins her reign as our new leader. She will be accompanied by two witnesses, Master Archer Bow, and Adora, She-Ra, Princess of Power. Let the light guide you and go forth in peace and safety to emerge as Queen of Bright Moon.",4,01
Adora," So, quest! Heh. We're good at quests.",4,01
Glimmer," Can we just do this, please? I don't want to think about flowers, or colors, or stupid decisions. And we're bad at quests.",4,01
Bow, Wow. I can't believe these tunnels have been underneath our feet all this time.,4,01
Adora," So, how deep down do you think we are?",4,01
Glimmer," Okay, what's with you guys? Stop acting like this!",4,01
Adora, Like what?,4,01
Glimmer, Like-- Like-- Like this!,4,01
Adora," Glimmer, we're just--",4,01
Glimmer, Whatever. None of this even matters!,4,01
Bow," Wait, look!",4,01
Bow, I think-- I think this is the Chamber of Queens!,4,01
Adora, Look!,4,01
Bow, That altar. I read about that in the scroll. I think it's for the lantern.,4,01
Adora, Is this part of the quest?,4,01
Bright Moon's guardian, ,4,01
Bow, Teeth! Giant Teeth!,4,01
Glimmer, The lantern!,4,01
Adora, Glimmer!,4,01
Bow, Glimmer!,4,01
Adora, The scroll didn't mention a giant angry monster living in the tunnels under Bright Moon?,4,01
Bow," Come to think of it, I might remember some mention of a Bright Moon guardian that we'd have to subdue.",4,01
Adora, Bow!,4,01
Bow, It was confusingly worded!,4,01
Adora," We need to get out of here. Come on, teleport us out!",4,01
Glimmer, I-- I can't teleport!,4,01
Adora, Glimmer!,4,01
Bow, What? Why not?,4,01
Glimmer, I haven't been recharging my powers!,4,01
Bow, What!,4,01
Adora, What!,4,01
Glimmer," Recharging would mean taking the Moonstone's full power for myself. It would mean... admitting that she's really gone. Everyone is already acting like she doesn't matter. It's like no one remembers her. No one cares. We're having a coronation because she's gone, and everyone is acting like it's a fun party and it's not.",4,01
Adora," Of course it's not. I just thought talking about it... About her. It hurts. I'm supposed to take care of you, Glimmer. It's the last thing she asked me to do. I wanted to make today perfect. But I...",4,01
Bow, We just don't know what to do.,4,01
Glimmer, I don't know either. But maybe we can still figure it out. Together.,4,01
Adora," Whatever path you choose, we'll always be there, right beside you.",4,01
Glimmer, Even if that path leads to a giant crystal monster?,4,01
Adora, Especially if the path leads to a giant crystal monster.,4,01
Bow, Nothing we can't handle. We're great at quests.,4,01
Glimmer,  Then come on. Let's do this.,4,01
Adora, For the Honor of Grayskull!,4,01
Glimmer, Hey! Over here!,4,01
Bow, Glimmer!,4,01
Adora, Run!,4,01
Glimmer," No. I'm Queen Glimmer of Bright Moon, and you will leave my friends alone.",4,01
Angella Hologram, Glimmer?,4,01
Glimmer,  Mom?,4,01
Angella Hologram," Glimmer, You are walking in the footsteps of all those who have come before us. Now, my darling, it's your turn. I wish I didn't have to leave you. But I know you will be all right. Because you are Glimmer, and you are so, so strong. I have done my best to prepare you to rule, but you were always ready to lead. I am so proud of you, Glimmer. I love you.",4,01
Glimmer, I love you too mom.,4,01
Bow," You okay, Your Majesty?",4,01
Glimmer," As long as you two are with me, I am. Now come on, let's get out of here.",4,01
Glimmer  , This place looks amazing!,4,01
Frosta, We wanted it to be perfect for you.,4,01
Perfuma, So we worked together to finish.,4,01
Mermista, That was my idea.,4,01
Castaspella," Glimmer, it's time.",4,01
Glimmer," I'm here today because Queen Angella, my mother, sacrificed herself to save Etheria. We can't let her bravery be in vain. But there's so much we still need to do. Hordak is still in power, and we know there's an even larger Horde army out there somewhere. We can't let them win. It's time for us to take back our home. Together we will push out the Horde, once and for all!",4,01
Bow, Yeah! Wooo!,4,01
Catra, purring,4,01
Catra," Hey, Hordak.",4,01
Hordak, What do you think you're doing?,4,01
Hordak, How dare you.,4,01
Catra, Missing something? Looks like you're ready to listen.,4,01
Hordak, When I finish with you...,4,01
Catra," Hey, cheer up, boss. You said it yourself. Big, bad Horde Prime got your signal. Don't you want to conquer Etheria before he gets here? He doesn't sound like the type to accept failure.",4,01
Hordak, What do you want?,4,01
Catra," We're done with your little vanity projects. It's time to crush the Rebellion, for good. And you're going to help me do that. I think you and I are going to do great things together.",4,01
Scorpia," Whoa, hey! Careful there.  Cool, right? Catra gave it to me in the Crimson Waste. She's got a matching one, it's like, our thing, you know?",4,06
Scorpia,"  I am brave, strong, loyal, and give great hugs.  And I am going to be the best friend that I CAN BE!",4,06
Scorpia,  Yep. Today will be a great day! ,4,06
Glimmer, You dropped one!,4,06
She-Ra, My bad! ,4,06
Bow," Watch your step!  At this rate, we'll have the supply line open in no time. Just hang back. ",4,06
Flutterina,  Looking for this?,4,06
Glimmer, This one's mine.,4,06
Glimmer, Looks like it's your lucky day.  I've got this rune I've really wanted to try out.,4,06
Glimmer,  Hey!  I had that one!,4,06
She-Ra,"  You are the Queen. I can't let anything happen to you.  Besides, whatever dark magic Shadow Weaver taught you  obviously doesn't seem to be doing the job...",4,06
Glimmer, It's not dark magic.  And it would have been really cool if it had worked!,4,06
Bow,"  Aw, you guys! Look at us!  The Best Friend Squad back together again!",4,06
Flutterina,"  Whoo! Take that, Horde!  Best first Rebellion mission ever! Thank you so much for letting me come.",4,06
Glimmer, This can't be all of them. Where's the rest? There aren't even any bots.,4,06
Flutterina, I didn't see any others.  They probably ran away scared.,4,06
She-Ra,  All right! We should head out. We've still got another outpost to shut down before we can re-open supply lines to the Kingdom of Snows. Come on! Let's move. ,4,06
Flutterina,  Wasn't She-Ra amazing in that battle? You are so lucky she saved you before that Horde soldier reached you.,4,06
Glimmer,  She didn't save me!  I was...doing...a thing.,4,06
Flutterina,"  Oh, right. I mean, your little magic trick would've been really cool if it had worked! Anyway, your real strength is in teamwork! And the way you let Adora give you orders even though you're the Queen, I-I--",4,06
Glimmer,  She wasn't giving me orders. We're a team!,4,06
Flutterina," The greatest team! That's why she can talk to you like that, all,  ""I'm She-Ra, I know best!"", but you stay friends.  What a bond...",4,06
Flutterina,"  Like lambs to the slaughter...  Hey, guys! Wait for me!",4,06
Hordak,  The Rebellion is dismantling our northern perimeter. Why are our outposts unprepared for an attack?,4,06
Catra,  Because they're skeleton crews. I've called back the main defenses.,4,06
Hordak,  What? Why?,4,06
Catra,"  Okay... The princesses have no idea what's coming. Let them waste their time on some useless outposts. We are saving our resources for the big mission.  The final part of our plan, remember?  It's almost time.",4,06
Hordak,  We're...not ready.  I need more time to complete the weapon.,4,06
Catra,  We've put everything into this plan. We don't have more time.,4,06
Hordak,"  This technology...is based on Entrapta's research, but I've reached a dead-end.  I need her notes...her recordings.  They must hold the key to making this work...",4,06
Catra,  Entrapta is a traitor.,4,06
Hordak,"  You think I don't know that?!  This is what she left behind. And this is what I will use to defeat every last princess on Etheria. Horde Prime will be here soon, and when he arrives he will see what I am capable of... I will return to his side--victorious...worthy. But first... I need. Those. Recordings.",4,06
Scorpia,"  Emily! You know you're supposed to stay in my room. Ya little scamp.  Come on, no guilt trip, it's for your own good. We can't let Catra see you, and right now? I'm bringing her a cup of my famous soothing tea. ...Old family recipe. If anyone could use a pick-me-up, it's Catra.",4,06
Scorpia, Go on.,4,06
Scorpia,"  Aaah, okay, you can come.  Can't say no to that cute little face.",4,06
Scorpia," Hey, I said you can come, where are you--",4,06
Catra, Who are you talking to? ,4,06
Scorpia," Catra! Oh!  Hot! Okay, boy, you can really  sneak up on a gal.  ...Oh, are--are you okay? You don't look so good, I--have you been getting enough sleep? ...Here. I made you some--",4,06
Catra," I didn't ask for your opinion. I have a job for you. I need you to find Entrapta's recordings, you know, that thingy she was always babbling into.",4,06
Scorpia, You want...Entrapta's recordings? Does this mean--,4,06
Catra," It means...that Hordak needs them.  I'm so close. If I can pull this off, everything, everything will have been worth it.  Find me those recordings so I can finish this.",4,06
Scorpia,"  Yes! Yes, I'll find them. I-I promise. D-Did you want any of the...tea? ...You know what, it's not a--",4,06
Catra,  What are you still doing here?! ,4,06
Scorpia," See, Emily? What did I tell you? Catra just needed a loyal friend. I'll find those recordings, she'll do her mission, and then she can relax, and things will go back to normal.",4,06
Lonnie,  Scorpia! A little help? ,4,06
Scorpia," Hey, guys! Can't stay long.  I'm on a super important, top-secret mission for Catra. ",4,06
Lonnie,  Good luck with that. I'm sure Catra will be super grateful.,4,06
Scorpia,"  Uh, yeah. Of course she'll be grateful.  Everything Catra's done has been to help the Horde. And if we stick with her, keep doing our jobs...I'm sure she'll notice.  ...You know...e-eventually...",4,06
Lonnie,"  Yeah, right. Our guys are getting attacked on the northern perimeter ...and Catra's letting it happen. She doesn't care about any of us.",4,06
Scorpia," No. No, you're wrong. Catra's been...under a lot of pressure...and maybe she just...",4,06
Lonnie,  When are you gonna wake up?!  ...Hey! We were supposed to be loading these onto the transport. Scorpia... just get out of here.  We've got real work to do.,4,06
Scorpia,"  Good idea. You go do your job, and I'll do mine.  Just a...well-oiled machine...",4,06
Bow,"  I don't see any defensive bots here, either. Honestly, it doesn't look like there's anyone on watch.",4,06
She-Ra," But we don't know what they've got inside the outpost, so let's go in nice and slow.  Here's what we're gonna do...I-- Glimmer!",4,06
She-Ra,"  Glimmer, what are you doing? You can't just rush into battle on your own like that, you're the Queen!  You're too valuable.",4,06
Glimmer,  Am I the Queen? Because it seems like you're the one giving all the  orders.,4,06
She-Ra,  And what's your plan? More dark magic? ,4,06
Glimmer,"  It's not dark magic! And I don't know,  maybe if it helps me do what needs to be  done!",4,06
She-Ra,"  Magic won't fix everything, you know! ",4,06
Glimmer,  What good is magic if I can't use it!,4,06
Flutterina,"  Double Trouble, sometimes you're too good...",4,06
She-Ra,  --you have us for!,4,06
Glimmer,  I don't need you guys  to save me! Stop treating me like I'm weak and let me make my own decisions! ,4,06
She-Ra,  We're just  looking out for you!,4,06
Bow, Hey! What's going on with you two?,4,06
She-Ra and Glimmer,  Nothing!,4,06
Bow,"  Okay, we're talking this out. Adora, is there something  you need to say to Glimmer?",4,06
She-Ra," No! I don't know! What, it's fine!",4,06
Bow,"  Come on, you can do it! Communication is the key to a good friendship!",4,06
She-Ra,  I don't know why Glimmer is suddenly okay with trusting Shadow Weaver after everything she's done to us! I'm just--I'm worried about her ...it's too dangerous.,4,06
Glimmer,  You really think I'm naive enough to trust her?,4,06
Bow,  Glimmer. Would you like to try phrasing that a little more constructively?,4,06
Glimmer,  Everything I'm doing is to protect people...is to protect you.  I'm not asking you to trust Shadow Weaver...but... can't you at least trust me?,4,06
She-Ra," Of course I trust you, Glimmer.",4,06
Bow,  There you go.  That's how the Best Friend Squad does it!,4,06
Flutterina,"  Ugh, I have to do everything around here.",4,06
Flutterina,"  HELP! HELP!  SHE-RA, HELP!",4,06
Glimmer, Flutterina!,4,06
Flutterina,  HELP! HELP! Put me down!  I'm on your side. Now follow my lead...  HEEEELP!,4,06
Scorpia,  Anything yet?,4,06
Scorpia,"  Aah, I know we've looked everywhere, but it's gotta be here somewhere...",4,06
Scorpia,"  Super Pal Trio. Man, those were good times, huh?  Focus! Scorpia, you can't let Catra down. ...Think like Entrapta... Think like Entrapta...  Bots!  Ehh, Hordak...  Tiny food.  Uh...First Ones tech... Runestones...  The Black Garnet Chamber!",4,06
Scorpia,"  Yeah, this place also gives me the creeps.  But, some of Entrapta's stuff is still in here, so the recordings might be, too.  Wow. So many good times in here, huh? That time Entrapta hacked the Black Garnet...That time Shadow Weaver tried to kill us...And...before that... You're not going to believe this, Emily, but I'm actually a princess.",4,06
Scorpia," I know, right? That's what they all say!  It's ridiculous, I know, but...it's true. The whole Fright Zone used to be my family's kingdom, but then Hordak showed up and...well...you know. The rest is history.  It's not like the Black Garnet ever worked for me anyway...",4,06
Scorpia," Ah, it's for the best. I mean, can you imagine? Me, a princess?  I just need to find those recordings and then--",4,06
Recording Entrapta," Commencing experiment number 703. Ready, Emily?",4,06
Scorpia,  Entrapta?,4,06
Recording Entrapta,"  Success! In addition to uploading back-ups of my logs into Emily's hard drive, I've upgraded her to record visual data.  Hiiii! Now when an experiment blows up and I lose all memory of that day, I'll still have record of the research.  Everyone, smile!",4,06
Recording Catra,  I told you to be ready to leave. Have you even started packing?,4,06
Recording Entrapta, I'm a scientist. The only thing I'll need in the Northern Reach is my miiind! ...Also my giant drill. ...Also...everything in this room.,4,06
Recording Scorpia,"  Super Pal Trio field trip! Ah, I can't wait! We can watch the snow fall, drink hot cocoa...",4,06
Recording Entrapta,"  Oh, can the hot cocoa's be tiny?",4,06
Recording Catra,"  We're there to dig up First Ones tech, we're not making cocoa.",4,06
Recording Scorpia," Oh, that's my Wildcat, always on goal.  ...What do you think is buried out there, anyway?",4,06
Recording Entrapta,"  Ohhh, something biiig!",4,06
Recording Catra, Who cares? Pack your stuff and let's go already.,4,06
Recording Scorpia,  I'll bring the cocoa if you bring the tiny mugs...?,4,06
Recording Entrapta,"  Oh, it's a date! ",4,06
Recording Scorpia, Yeah!,4,06
Scorpia,"  I...I miss her.  Wait, Entrapta's recordings...she stored them inside you?!  We did it, you beautiful bot, we found them! Oh, we've gotta go tell Catra that-- ...Well, can't you just take them out?  Not possible?!  They're deeply ingrained in your core processor and can't be accessed without dismantling you completely?!",4,06
Scorpia,"  But Catra needs these recordings, and I wanna be there for her! I'm loyal,  that's my whole thing-- ...I'm sure it'll be fine. She wouldn't hurt you. She wouldn't...even though the recordings are...inside you and...she's kind of said the words ""scrap metal"" and ""Emily"" together a lot. ...Come on, I know a great place to hide--I-I mean, think, not hide. We're not hiding, we're...thinking. That's it.",4,06
She-Ra," Bow, can you take them out?",4,06
Bow, I can't risk hitting Flutterina!,4,06
Flutterina,"  Come on, work with me here!",4,06
Soldier,  Uh...drop your weapons...or the girl...gets it?,4,06
Flutterina,"  Ugh, it'll do.",4,06
Glimmer,"  Let her go, now. Or it's not gonna be pretty. ",4,06
She-Ra,"  Glimmer, no. They could hurt Flutterina.",4,06
Glimmer,  Someone has to do something. ,4,06
Glimmer,  Why isn't anyone guarding these outposts? Where is everyone?,4,06
Soldier,"  Ah, I don't know!",4,06
Glimmer,"  I haven't practiced this one as much...I'm still getting the hang of it.  It's a truth spell, if it works...but if it fails, it can be...extremely painful.",4,06
Soldier,"  Okay, okay! Catra called back our bots and most of our team, but--I don't know why, I swear!  I don't, I really don't!",4,06
Glimmer,  I think you do...,4,06
Bow,"  Glimmer, stop!",4,06
Glimmer,"  Catra pulled her forces from the northern perimeter. We've been wasting our time all day. And this guy... is wasting mine.  Bow, put him back with the others and let's go.",4,06
She-Ra,"  Glimmer, what are you doing? You took things way too far.",4,06
Glimmer,  I wasn't going to actually hurt him. Did you think I would really--,4,06
Bow," Look, maybe we should get some rest and talk about this when--",4,06
She-Ra,  The Kingdom of Snows' supply line is open. We're done here.,4,06
Glimmer, Fine by me. ,4,06
Flutterina,  And scene. ,4,06
Scorpia," Welcome to Horror Hall! It was part of the royal Scorpion Family's kingdom, but nobody comes here anymore.  I would sneak down here to hide when I was a kid. Yeah...  Oh! Check out these guys! That's Pointy, over there is Captain Pointy, and this here is the widow Madame Pointessa.  Okay, I made those up, I don't know their names.  But this!",4,06
Scorpia," This guy...this is my granddad, the King. He was the greatest. I mean, that's what the Horde told me anyway, I don't remember him, I was too young.  I have granddad to thank for my opportunities in life. He made the alliance with Hordak. As part of it, our kingdom gave up our Runestone...and...princess... My granddad must've known I'd be...happier...as a soldier. And I made friends in the Horde...like you!",4,06
Scorpia,"  Ah. Okay, well...  Things didn't exactly work out for my kingdom, but...granddad stayed loyal to the end. That's what scorpions do best! Brave, loyal...great hugs.",4,06
Scorpia," I need to be there for Catra. I'll just tell her about the recordings. She is my friend, and she will not hurt you if I ask her not to.",4,06
Recording Catra,  I don't care what it takes. We are opening that portal! NOW!,4,06
Recording Entrapta,"  No! I won't! I need to tell Hordak, he'll understand!",4,06
Recording Catra,  Get her out of here! I don't care--! Put her on the transport to Beast Island!,4,06
Scorpia,  She--she was threatened. She didn't mean it...,4,06
Recording Scorpia, Beast Island?! You can't!,4,06
Recording Catra,  You wanna be next?,4,06
Scorpia,  Catra...betrayed her. ...She betrayed me. And I just let her take Entrapta away... Catra doesn't...care. She'll hurt people to get her way. If she knew the recordings were inside of you...,4,06
Scorpia,  But I still have time. I can still be a good friend.,4,06
Catra,  You better have something for me.,4,06
Scorpia,  ...Entrapta's recordings. She stored them all in Emily.,4,06
Scorpia," The chip got damaged when I extracted it, but...hopefully that won't matter? It was just so small, and you know...pincers.",4,06
Catra,  You broke...the recordings?,4,06
Scorpia,  I-I didn't mean to--,4,06
Catra,"  I asked you to do one thing! One simple thing and you completely ruined it!  But of course you ruined it. Yeah. You're Scorpia. That's just what you do! You couldn't handle Emily...You never know when to shut up...The only thing you've ever done  is get in my way! What did I expect, I mean, how could you possibly be this useless?!",4,06
Catra, What?!,4,06
Scorpia,  ...You're a bad friend.,4,06
Hordak,  The recordings?,4,06
Catra, Entrapta must've taken them with her before leaving. There's nothing.,4,06
Hordak,  I gave you...an order...,4,06
Catra,"  Get. Over. It.  You don't need Entrapta. You never did. You don't need a princess in your life telling you what to do. Look at what you've done without her. You built an army. An empire.  You and me...we don't need anyone.  Forget them all, no one matters,  nothing matters but this mission.  You want to prove yourself? Prove your worth? Then do it. You and I are going to conquer Etheria, and then...and then, they'll all see!",4,06
Hordak,"  Oh, of course...  Yes. We will prevail. Give me another day, and I will be ready.",4,06
Catra,  Does that mean...I can give the command?,4,06
Hordak,  It is time.,4,06
Scorpia,"  Okay, I bought us some time. Catra didn't know that was just old junk or that I was...lying to her.  ...There's nothing I can do for her...but maybe I can still help Entrapta.",4,06
Scorpia,"  Ready for a Super Pal Duo field trip?  We're getting out of here, Emily. For good.",4,06
Glimmer, I called you all here to discuss what happened today. The mission to retake Dryl was a complete disaster. We barely made it out.  I wanna know why.,4,07
Bow," The Horde knew we were coming, they were ready for us. How do they keep doing this? We thought they were tracking Adora, but she wasn't even there today!",4,07
Mermista, Isn't it obvious?  There's a Horde spy somewhere in Bright Moon.  ...And no one is going anywhere until we figure out who it is. ,4,07
Glimmer, Mermista... it's very unlikely that there's a spy--,4,07
Mermista," We need to investigate. Obviously, I'll be the lead detective since I've read every single Mer-Mystery book.",4,07
Adora, Mer-what?,4,07
Mermista,"  Mer-Mystery! It's only the best undersea novel series ever, there's, like, 18 of them, it taught me everything I need to know about solving mysteries.  Murder mysteries! ",4,07
Perfuma,  Um...but no one's been murdered...,4,07
Mermista,"  YET!  First, we need to question the suspects.",4,07
Frosta, Who are the suspects?,4,07
Mermista,  Everyone  is a suspect.,4,07
Bow,  Everyone?  Is anyone else sweating? I'm sweating!,4,07
Glimmer, This is a waste of time. We know that the Horde is pulling their troops back to prepare for something big. That's what we should be investigating.,4,07
Adora," No, Mermista's right. And, we know it can't be me the Horde's tracking since , once again, you used me as a distraction today.  ...A spy is really the only thing that makes sense.",4,07
Glimmer," Maybe they didn't fall for the distraction because you're a bad actress. And who would the spy even be, anyway?",4,07
Adora,"  How about the Horde officer who's living at-- I'm sorry--being held prisoner, at Bright Moon?  Shadow Weaver has actual shadow spies--we met them.",4,07
Perfuma,  Spoilers!,4,07
Mermista,  It's time to interrogate the castle! ,4,07
Frosta, ...How are you doing that?!,4,07
Mermista,  I practice. At. HOME! ,4,07
Catra," Move, now! We don't have all night, Kyle!",4,07
Double Trouble," Meoow. You all right there, kitten?",4,07
Catra, About time you checked in. Are the princesses still moping around about Dryl?,4,07
Double Trouble,"  No. Watching them mope was my favorite. Now they're playing detective,  searching for the elusive Horde spy who foiled their plans.",4,07
Catra," Wait, spy?  Is your cover blown?",4,07
Double Trouble," Please, who would suspect a goody-two-shoes like  Flutterina? Besides, if they start to get suspicious, I'll just do a quick wardrobe change and throw the blame onto someone else. ",4,07
Catra,"  They better not. You have to keep them in Bright Moon. If they catch on before our plan is complete, before the big mission is done, I--",4,07
Double Trouble,"  Darling, darling, don't worry. I'll just tire them out a bit.",4,07
Mermista,  Where were you when the murders happened? ,4,07
Bright Moon General, The what?,4,07
Perfuma,"   ...Don't think you can get away with it.  ...Although, there still weren't any murders, Mermista.",4,07
Mermista,  Yet! ,4,07
Bright Moon General,  I sincerely do not have time for this.,4,07
Mermista," Uh, according to a bunch of other people--",4,07
Perfuma, Witnesses!,4,07
Mermista, --you weren't where you were supposed to be at the Battle for Dryl.,4,07
Bright Moon General, I followed the plan exactly.,4,07
Perfuma,  A likely--!  Sorry...  A likely story!,4,07
Bright Moon General,"  Look, this is what happened.",4,07
General," On approach to Dryl, Glimmer filled me in. She-Ra would lure away the Horde. Team A--Frosta, Bow, and Flutterina--would scout ahead. Team B--Sea Hawk and Mermista--would guard the exits. Team A indicated the coast was clear and we converged on their signal.  But that's when Frosta ran into us and said they hadn't finished scouting! ",4,07
Perfuma," Oh, my!",4,07
General,"  Team A sent the all-clear. If you want to know what went wrong, ask Bow.",4,07
Bow,"  Okay, I confess, it was me!",4,07
Frosta," Bow, we're not even interrogating you.",4,07
Bow," I mean, if I am the spy, it's an accident...I think... Can you be an accidental spy? Do I have an evil alter-ego? Or was I secretly brainwashed and I'm just realizing it now?!",4,07
Plumerian Man," So, like, are you guys still questioning me, or...?",4,07
Bow,  It all goes back to what happened in Dryl...,4,07
Bow," Everyone was in position, and I was using my new tech to look for remaining Horde soldiers.  But then my goggles glitched and--I don't know what happened! I started to see double.  That's when the other team came in way too early! I tried to signal everyone to fall back, but my tracker pad was missing. ",4,07
Plumerian Man,  Whoaaa...,4,07
Bow," Don't you see what this means? Either I lost my tracker pad at Dryl, and that gave the Horde vital information...or...I did it on purpose because I am the spy and I gave the signal and I didn't even know! ",4,07
Plumerian man,  You're blowing my miiiind...!,4,07
Frosta,  BOW!  You aren't. The spy!,4,07
Bow,  You don't know that!  It all makes sense... Who else could it be?!,4,07
Adora, So you're telling us you really didn't know anything about the plan to retake Dryl? Really?,4,07
Shadow Weaver," Not a bit. I've been busy with my garden. She's always been paranoid like this, you know.",4,07
Adora,"  I am not being paranoid. You were spotted around the castle without your guards this morning, and I wanna know why...",4,07
Glimmer," Actually, Adora, that's--",4,07
Shadow Weaver, I was engaging in a ritual. ,4,07
Shadow Weaver," Essence of echinacea.  A dash of ginger root.   Ah, my daily morning ritual. ",4,07
Adora,"  Okay, you expect us to believe you were just having tea?! She's the spy, you're the spy! Who else could it be?",4,07
Shadow Weaver," I am not the villain of this story. As to your question, Glimmer saw fit to grant me free reign of the castle. My guards have been dismissed.",4,07
Adora,  No guards? Seriously?!,4,07
Glimmer,"  Yes, seriously! What has she done other than help us?",4,07
Adora,  Do you really want me to answer that?,4,07
Shadow Weaver," Girls, every moment you waste here, the Horde gets that much further ahead.  In order to catch a rat, you need to spring a trap.",4,07
Adora," Well, in order to catch the spy ...we need you to admit that you're the spy--!",4,07
Glimmer,"  Let it go, Adora! There's lots of other people it could be.",4,07
Adora, Like who?,4,07
Sea Hawk,"  Ah, I love recounting the epic tales of my exploits. My HEROIC exploits.",4,07
Mermista,"  Yeah, it definitely isn't Sea Hawk. Why did you even bring him in?",4,07
Perfuma, You said everyone was a suspect.,4,07
Sea Hawk,  Exploits for the ages! Narration!,4,07
Mermista," Wait, is that where my book went?  Sea Hawk, I've been looking for it!",4,07
Sea Hawk, That's when the clouds parted--,4,07
Sea Hawk,  --and illuminated my dearest Mermista in the distance. ,4,07
 Mermista, Moonlight? The battle happened this morning.,4,07
Sea Hawk," I made my way over to her, when----we were ambushed! My sole aim was to protect Mermista from the Horde... Thinking quick,  I took on the 40 to 50 Horde soldiers surrounding us and SAVED DRYL!",4,07
Mermista,"  We lost Dryl, and you punched, like, one guy before Glimmer got us out.",4,07
Sea Hawk, Exactly! One HUNDRED guys!,4,07
Perfuma,"  W-Wait, wait--I-I was with the General the whole time!  And why weren't you with Sea Hawk, Mermista?",4,07
Mermista," Uh, because Frosta waved me over, but, like, disappeared before I could reach her.",4,07
Perfuma," But that doesn't make any sense, she was with Bow, and then...Glimmer and the others were--",4,07
Sea Hawk, Who wants to watch me do some squats? ,4,07
Sea Hawk,  I bet Adora and Glimmer don't shove suspects out the door...,4,07
Glimmer,"   ...Okay, Flutterina. Where were you at the start of the battle?",4,07
Flutterina," With Bow and Frosta, of course. Like we planned.  ...Is...Is everything okay?",4,07
Glimmer, Everything is fine. Now--,4,07
Flutterina," It's just that, everyone's so on edge after what happened in Dryl. Have you tried interviewing Shadow Weaver about it? She seems kinda untrustworthy...",4,07
Adora,"  Oh, noo, according to Glimmer,  she's totally trustworthy, and  it's fine to just let her walk around the castle  whenever she wants...",4,07
Glimmer, Can we please not start this up again?,4,07
Adora," I'm just saying, it would have been nice if you told me.",4,07
Glimmer,  I don't have to tell you about every decision I make.,4,07
Adora,"  Oh, but you tell Shadow Weaver?!",4,07
Glimmer, Maybe it's because Shadow Weaver actually listened when you and Bow kept  leaving without me!,4,07
Flutterina, You two seem like you have a lot to talk about... Maybe I'll just come back later...,4,07
Glimmer," I don't know why I'm going along with this. The Horde is obviously planning something. We should be out there, looking for them, not stuck here, playing around.",4,07
Adora,"  No one's playing around, Glimmer. There is a reason we've been losing.",4,07
Glimmer,  And we're going to keep losing if we don't act soon.,4,07
Glimmer, Who is even left to question?,4,07
Dryl cook, I think I saw Mermista with Bow's tracker pad.,4,07
Bow," Wait, have you guys been here the entire time?",4,07
Other Dryl cook, ...Tiny scone?,4,07
Mermista,"  Ugh, that one's so predictable. I saw that twist coming a mile away.",4,07
Adora, Swift Wind! You weren't even there!,4,07
Sea Hawk," I told you how I took out one hundred--no--one hundred and fifty guys, right?",4,07
Bow,"  You have to arrest me, for everyone's safety! Otherwise my evil alter-ego might do it again!",4,07
Glimmer,"  Bow, knock it off.",4,07
Adora, Still no! ...And put that back.,4,07
Mermista, It's not them.,4,07
Perfuma,  No.,4,07
Glimmer,  No.,4,07
Plumerian Man," I think, like, maybe She-Ra did it.",4,07
Frosta, Hey! We already questioned you.,4,07
Plumerian Man," Oh, yeah. I came back for the tiny scones.",4,07
Other Dryl Cook, I made a fresh batch! ,4,07
Dryl Cook, Fizzy beverage?,4,07
(Things that could be made out,,4,07
Perfuma," If you just lent me the book, then I'd show you who done it! I think we should interrogate him again! I don't trust--",4,07
Mermista, --happened in Pearl In The Window.),4,07
Adora, Glimmer? Where are you going?,4,07
Glimmer,  This isn't working. Nothing we do is working. The Horde is always ahead and I can't just sit here and wait for the next bad thing to happen.,4,07
Adora," So, what? You're gonna teleport into the Fright Zone and try to solve this all by yourself?",4,07
Glimmer, Someone's gotta do something.,4,07
Adora,"  Glimmer, please. You can't leave in the middle of the night without backup.",4,07
Glimmer," The less people involved, the better. We don't know who to trust.",4,07
Adora,  And what about me? Were you gonna tell me? Or Bow?,4,07
Glimmer," Adora, I--",4,07
Adora," Stay.  Please. I know we can figure this out if we work together. No more secrets, and doing things without us. We need you here.  ...I need you here.",4,07
Glimmer,  Okay. I'm here.,4,07
Bow,  Adora! Glimmer!,4,07
Frosta, Where have you guys been?!,4,07
Perfuma, The communications panel in the war room has been severed!,4,07
Adora, When did this happen?,4,07
Mermista, I don't know. We were passing by the room when we saw it.,4,07
Frosta,  Wait. We saw you run out of here two minutes ago.,4,07
Mermista,"  Uh, what are you talking about? I was with Perfuma.",4,07
Perfuma, Could the storm have done something to cause this?,4,07
Glimmer, This wasn't an accident. This was sabotage. ,4,07
Glimmer," ...The General is working on restoring communications. In the meantime, there's a backup device in the dining room, should we need it.",4,07
Mermista,  All of us here knew we were trying to unmask the spy. And we were the ones who made the plan to take back Dryl. We've ruled out all other suspects. Which means the only person the spy could be is one. Of. Us.,4,07
Frosta,  Perfuma was the one who let the Horde take the doors!,4,07
Perfuma," I wasn't there!  Wait, your team was the one who told us to come in, and you led Mermista away!",4,07
Frosta,  I. Did. Not.,4,07
Mermista," Trying to throw the blame on someone else, huh, Frosta?",4,07
Frosta," If Mermista knows so much about mysteries, she'd probably know how to plan the perfect crime.",4,07
Perfuma,  And there was water by the tracker pad!,4,07
Mermista, Water that could've been melted ice!,4,07
Bow,  It's probably me!,4,07
Frosta,"  It's not you, Bow!",4,07
Sea Hawk," It couldn't be me, I was busy fighting at least 200 soldiers!",4,07
Adora," This is a waste of time, Glimmer. Shouldn't we be--?",4,07
Glimmer,"  Stop.  Stop questioning my choices, stop whining about being a decoy, just--stop. Okay?",4,07
Adora,  I'm not whining!,4,07
Glimmer, All you do is question me. Question my authority. It's exhausting.,4,07
Sea Hawk,"  Okay, I lied. I didn't fight 300 soldiers. Mermista, will you ever forgive me?",4,07
Mermista," Sea Hawk, we all knew that.",4,07
Bow, I don't know who to believe anymore...I can't trust my own eyes!  Who am I?!,4,07
Adora, Look at what she's doing. Look at what she's doing to you. Shadow Weaver just wants power and you are listening to her.,4,07
Glimmer," Oh, what? Are you jealous because you aren't Shadow Weaver's favorite anymore?  Or are you just mad that I'm Queen and in charge and you're not?",4,07
Adora, That's. Ridiculous!,4,07
Glimmer,  You just run around playing the perfect hero. You have no idea how hard it's been for me.,4,07
Adora,  Because you stopped including me in your decisions! We used to be a team. And now? I don't know what we are.,4,07
Flutterina,"  Come on, backup communicator, where are youuu?",4,07
Glimmer," Hey, Flutterina. Looking for something?",4,07
Flutterina,"  Glimmer?  Adora. Hi...Hi. Uh, just looking for the bathroom. ",4,07
Flutterina," Okay...Okay, this looks bad, but I assure you, it isn't what it looks like, so let's all just--",4,07
Flutterina,  Ohoho. I see...,4,07
Glimmer," Give it up, Flutterina. If that's really who you are.",4,07
Flutterina, Magic. How very clever.,4,07
Adora, Isn't it? Shadow Weaver helped.,4,07
Glimmer, You see--,4,07
Mermista,  The reveal of how they caught the murderer is my favorite part!,4,07
Adora," In order to catch a rat, you need to spring a trap. So we set one up of our own.",4,07
Mermista, Classic murder mystery move.,4,07
Perfuma, There's no murder--never mind.,4,07
Glimmer, We knew a backup communication device would be irresistible to whoever destroyed the original.,4,07
Adora," We wanted the spy to feel safe enough to make a move, so we created a diversion.",4,07
Glimmer, Adora managed to be a really good actress...for once.,4,07
Adora,"  It was really hard, do not ask me to do that again.",4,07
Glimmer, So that brings us back to you. Who are you really...Flutterina?,4,07
'Adora', Please.,4,07
Double Trouble, Call me Double Trouble.,4,07
Adora, You're a shapeshifter...,4,07
Bow,"  It wasn't my goggles glitching. It was you, pretending to be Frosta at Dryl.",4,07
Double Trouble," And Perfuma. Don't short change my credits, darling.",4,07
Double Trouble," May I say, as one actor to another, that was truly a masterful performance. I really bought that you two were furious at each other. If you would indulge me, were you inspired by any real emotion or experience?",4,07
Glimmer,"  Enough. It's over, Double Trouble. Now tell us what the Horde is planning...",4,07
Double Trouble," Over?  Ohohoho, love, it's just beginning. The Horde has been planning a massive attack for some time now.",4,07
Double Trouble," I let Catra know you were going to Dryl.  After that, all I had to do was plant seeds of doubt.  Sowing chaos where I could.  It wasn't hard. I just had to keep you isolated and at each other's throats until...",4,07
Double Trouble," ...the plan was underway. ...Salineas. If the Horde controls the seas, they control Etheria.",4,07
Glimmer," That will never happen. We won't let it. Now that we know their plan, we can stop it.",4,07
Double Trouble,"  Oh, stop it? Oh, this was a ruse, darling. A distraction. The Battle of Salineas is over. It happened earlier this very evening. It's too late. Salineas is gone.",4,07
Mermista,  No...,4,07
Glimmer," No. No, i-i-it's not too late! It can't be! ",4,07
Adora, ...We can fix this. We have to be able to fix this...right?,4,07
Glimmer,"  This won't. Happen. Again. I won't let it. We won't give up. We will take back Salineas, take back all of Etheria...",4,07
Glimmer, No matter what it costs. No matter what the Horde throws at us next.,4,07
Hordak,  Advance.,4,08
Sea Hawk,"  Fear not, tiny friends...  For Sea Hawk is here!",4,08
Sea Hawk," Well, perhaps we should fear a little.  Let's go! ",4,08
Glimmer,  Hang on! ,4,08
Sea Hawk,  Huh?,4,08
Glimmer,"  Netossa, this is the last of them, sound the--wait. Where's Sea Hawk? ",4,08
Sea Hawk,  ...Adventure?,4,08
Glimmer, Okay. Now sound the retreat.,4,08
Glimmer,  I'll be back for you.,4,08
Bow,"  I know it's been tough going since losing Salineas, but we're picking up the pieces. I'm sure we can turn this around. I mean, we captured Double Trouble. They're...refusing to talk to us, but still. So, uh... Swift Wind!  You just got back from scouting the Southern Coast. What does it look like?",4,08
Swift Wind,  On fire.,4,08
Bow, Anything more specific?,4,08
Swift Wind,  On lots of fire.,4,08
Bow,  Okayyy... Adora! You came from Plumeria; what's their status? Any good news?,4,08
Adora,  Perfuma is securing the Whispering Woods and Frosta reports that her kingdom has not been breached....,4,08
Bow,  Great.,4,08
Adora, ...yet.  But the Horde's working on it. Day and night. Nonstop.,4,08
Bow,"  Well...that is...ooo-kayyy. Because Sea Hawk, Netossa, and Spinnerella just saved everyone in Sea Elf Village...with Glimmer. Who didn't tell us she was going, but just...kind of showed up. ",4,08
Adora,"  Again? Glimmer, you can't just keep going off on your own.",4,08
Glimmer,"  Hmm, where have I heard that before?  Oh, right. When I stayed here to find the Horde spy and Salineas fell.",4,08
Adora,  That's not fair. We didn't know.,4,08
Glimmer,  Tell that to Mermista.,4,08
Swift Wind," Hey, where is Mermista?",4,08
Mermista,"  Oh, look. More ice cream. Cause I'm the princess of ice cream now. ",4,08
Sea Hawk,"  She's, um, taking some ""me time"".",4,08
Bow,"  ""Me time""! Great... We all could use some of that. So let's check in with each other more often, and Glimmer if you could--",4,08
Glimmer,  I'm not going to hide inside the castle while our people are in danger. I'm the Queen. You don't give me orders.,4,08
Bow,"  O...kay, I get that you're upset, but--",4,08
Adora,  Don't talk to Bow like that.,4,08
Bow," Adora, it's fine, Glimmer's just--",4,08
Glimmer, I need to stop the Horde. Any way I can. ...We're done for today. ,4,08
Adora,"  Ugh, fine. Clearly, we aren't going to get anything done right now. ",4,08
Sea Hawk," All in all, not the worst meeting we've had.",4,08
Bow,  I've never seen Glimmer like this. Or Adora. I just wish I knew how to help them.,4,08
Sea Hawk,"  Ah, don't blame yourself, lad.  ...Hey, you know, I just had an idea, not pre-planned at all. Let's take a break and have a boys' night out on the town!",4,08
Swift Wind,"  Can I come, too?",4,08
Bow,  I should really stay here in case Glimmer and Adora need me...,4,08
Sea Hawk, One night off won't hurt.  What do you say?,4,08
Swift Wind,"  Boys' night out, boys' night out, boys' night out, BOYS' NIGHT OUT!  ...Why am I the only one doing this?",4,08
Bow, You know what? Why not?,4,08
Sea Hawk, Grand!  And then my brilliant secret plan can begin...,4,08
Bow, What's that?,4,08
Sea Hawk,  Nothingggg!  Forward to a friendship adventure!,4,08
Catra, Lord Hordak. Sounds like congratulations are in order.,4,08
Hordak,"  Yes... The princesses are in utter disarray...abandoning territory, scattering like cowards before us like the cowards they are.",4,08
Catra,"  We're crushing them. Once you return to the Fright Zone, I'll march our troops on the rest of the coastal towns.",4,08
Hordak," No. Now that Horde Prime's arrival is imminent, I shall remain in the field to ensure victory. ...Besides. Out of all the princesses, Entrapta has yet to face me on the field...",4,08
Catra,  And what exactly am I supposed to do while you remain in the field?,4,08
Hordak,  Whatever I deem necessary to win. Return to your post in the Fright Zone and await my orders.  ...Soon all of Etheria will be at my feet.,4,08
Catra," Force Captain Octavia, have you finished your perimeter?",4,08
"Octavia, over the radio", We're doing the final sweep.,4,08
Catra," Excellent. Double Trouble should be breaking radio silence soon...they'll have new coordinates for you.  Force Captain Scorpia, come in.",4,08
Catra," Aw, man. Even when he's winning, Hordak is annoying. Now he suddenly loves fighting, and I'm getting stuck with whatever he  ""deems necessary"".  Never thought I'd miss shut-in Hordak.  Meet me at the Sea Gate,  I wanna take a break anyway.",4,08
Bow," Sea Hawk, I thought you said boys' night out, it's the middle of day.",4,08
Sea Hawk,"  New experiences!  Huzzah!  Day, night, it matters not. You're overdue for some levity.",4,08
Bow,"  Last time I was here it was with Adora and Glimmer, and...things were great... Not like now.",4,08
Sea Hawk, It is true. Things are looking...dour...,4,08
Sea Hawk, This drink is...extra sour...,4,08
Sea Hawk, Could be the Rebellion's......darkest...hour...  Nonsense! You know why?  Hit it!,4,08
Sea Hawk,"  Oh, when the seas are rough and dire / we turn to friends and we conspire / to relight the sacred fire / of rebellion!  When the Horde tightens their noose / around our daring sea rescues / we take some time to cut loose / from the rebellion! Sure friends aren't seeing eye to eye! / Tis no reason to curl up and die!  Friendship just needs a resupply!",4,08
Swift Wind and Sea Hawk,"  Oh it's fun, it's fun to be friends with friends! / Oh it's fun, it's fun to be friends with friends!",4,08
Sea Hawk," And when Hordak hits us robotical / we'll respond with tunes most...nautical / and take a moment to...to... to, to, to, to  t-uh, to pop!  soda botticals! ",4,08
Swift Wind," Oh, man. Third rhyme. Rough stuff.",4,08
Sea Hawk and Swift Wind,"  Oh how fun, how fun to be friends with friends! / Oh how fun, how fun to be friends with friends!",4,08
Bow,"  Sometimes we'll fight but that's okay, we'll work it out another day / I know things will work out in the end!",4,08
Sea Hawk,"  Oh, yes!",4,08
"Sea Hawk, Bow, and Swift Wind",  Cause it's fun to be friends with friends! / Oh it's fun to be friends with friends!,4,08
"Sea Hawk, Bow, and Swift Wind",  Oh it's fun to be friends with friends!,4,08
Bow,  It's an ambush!,4,08
Sea Hawk,"  Whoo, better! It's a kidnapping!",4,08
Bow,"  Sea Hawk, what are you doing?!",4,08
Sea Hawk, Don't worry. It's all a part of my brilliant secret plan.,4,08
Swift Wind,  What plan?,4,08
Sea Hawk," To unite the princesses and cheer up my dearest Mermista. They love rescuing people... so I paid my friend Bill to kidnap us!  The ladies will put aside their problems to rescue us, go on a mission of fun, and then it's a happy ending for all!",4,08
Bow,  Wait. You paid them to--,4,08
Sea Hawk,"  The princesses will stop their fight / When they save us, it'll be all right / We'll hang with Bill the rest / of the night / it's fun to be friends with friends...sha-boom-bity-boom-bam-boo... / Hey, Bill, did you get...taller? and when did you get that...scar? You, uh, you didn't...have a scar...  This might not be Bill.  ...No, this isn't Bill.",4,08
Bow,  What?!,4,08
Swift Wind,  What do we do?,4,08
Bow,"  We have to get a message to our friends. Swift Wind, try to contact Adora through your sacred bond.",4,08
Sea Hawk,"  Yeah, yeah, yes-yes. My plan can still work. They'll just unite to rescue us for real this time. Nothing's spun out of control... Do your thing, noble steed.",4,08
Swift Wind,"  Come on, Adora, pick up.  Pick up...",4,08
Glimmer,  Mermista? Are you alone?,4,08
Mermista,  Totally...,4,08
Glimmer, I thought you said you were alone?,4,08
Mermista,  I am... Deep down inside...so...alone...  Are you two gonna fight again?  Whatever...,4,08
Glimmer," I was just...checking up on Mermista, but, clearly, you have it covered. ",4,08
Adora,"  Glimmer, what is going on with you? I know things are bad right now, but...we can fix it--",4,08
Glimmer,  Why is that always your answer to everything?!,4,08
Adora,  Because it's the only thing we can do.,4,08
Glimmer,"  Things are worse than ever. The Horde has Salineas, the coast is falling, we haven't FIXED anything!",4,08
Adora,"  That's why we need to work together instead of you pushing us away, and if you'd just listened to us, you'd know that,  and why can I hear the ocean right now?!",4,08
Bow, Anything?,4,08
Swift Wind,"  Ah! She hung up on me. But I could tell that she's in distress... I-I should be at her side, right now! ",4,08
Bow,"  Swift Wind, calm. Down. It'll be okay. We'll figure something out.",4,08
Sea Hawk, Fear not. I know how to get a message to my sweet Mermista. After all...she taught me how to speak  seagullllll!  ...I may be a bit rusty.,4,08
Not Bill, What's all this yammering about?,4,08
Sea Hawk,"  Admiral--!  Admiral Scurvy, my old friend... It's just like you to, uh, take over someone else's jovial prank... Isn't it fun being friends?  Oooohhh--!",4,08
Scurvy,"  Absolutely not!  Friends? Heh. We were friends. But I've had to rebuild my last three ships because you set them on fire.  Honestly, who does that?!",4,08
Sea Hawk,"  Come on, now, Scurvy...isn't this all just a bit extreme? ",4,08
Bow, Admiral Scurvy! ...Sir! Whatever Sea Hawk has done in the past...can't you put that aside for the sake of your friendship?,4,08
Scurvy," Friendship? Whoo, boy...  Listen up, kid. Friendship  is overrated.  There's only one thing in this world that matters...money. And lucky for you, the three of you have some value to me yet.",4,08
Sea Hawk, This was all a terrible idea. Why didn't anyone stop me?,4,08
Swift Wind,  Because you didn't tell us. Why didn't you tell us?!,4,08
Sea Hawk,"  If I told you, you would have stopped me.",4,08
Bow,  ...It's okay!  'Cause it's fun to be friends with friends!  Remember?,4,08
Sea Hawk,  This is no time for songs.,4,08
Swift Wind," Yeah, read the room, Bow.",4,08
Bow,"  Look, as soon as they realize we're gone, Adora and Glimmer will stop fighting and come for us. I know they will.",4,08
Catra,"  Hey, Scorpia. Where are you? It's not like you to be late.  ...Listen, I'll kill you if you tell anyone this, but... I thought winning would be...different. Or at least, more...  I don't know... Fun?",4,08
Catra," Come on. You're not still mad about before... Are ya?  Stop being so sensitive. Get over it and talk to me, Scorpia.",4,08
Catra, ...Scorpia?  ...Scorpia?!,4,08
Scurvy," Good news, boys. Someone cared enough about you three,  to pay a hefty ransom!",4,08
Sea Hawk, The princesses...of course! Just like I planned.,4,08
Scurvy,"  All that very loud, very public singing about the Rebellion, and you think your ransom was paid by the princesses?",4,08
Scurvy, The Horde controls the seas now. And they're paying top dollar for high-ranking Rebel prisoners.,4,08
Octavia,  As promised.,4,08
Sea Hawk,  Scurvy...don't do this.You and I lived by a sacred code...the law of the sea. We are like brothers... If our friendship ever meant anything to you--,4,08
Scurvy,  It didn't.,4,08
Scurvy,"  Your friends aren't coming, kid. I don't think they've even noticed you're gone.  Oh, friends...",4,08
"[Glimmer and Adora can be heard arguing, muffled inside the bathroom where Mermista sinks lower into her tub; the seagull that Sea Hawk spoke to flies in and lands on Mermista's tail, squawking, until she gasps; some things that can be heard overlapping while this happens are",,4,08
Glimmer, Just because you're She-Ra doesn't mean you can order people around!,4,08
Adora, You just keep pushing us away!,4,08
Glimmer," I am Queen of Etheria, okay? Not--",4,08
Adora, --and going rogue and leaving! What are we supposed to do with that? We're trying our best!],4,08
Adora,  Why are you blaming this all on me? It's not my fault that Salineas fell! The Horde manipulated all of us!,4,08
Glimmer,  She-Ra was supposed to save us. But the Rebellion's in a worse place than ever since you showed up!,4,08
Adora,  I'm trying my best. Why can't you see that?,4,08
Glimmer,"  Well, maybe your best isn't good enough. If it was, my mother would still be here!",4,08
Glimmer,  Adora--Adora I'm I'm sorry...,4,08
Mermista,"  The boys are in trouble! A seagull told me! I may have lost my kingdom, but I'm not losing anyone else.  Sea-Ra is back in action!  Let's go!",4,08
Sea Hawk, So...what happened to the eye?,4,08
Octavia," Oh,  this? Catra scratched it out when she was six. And now...  I bet she's gonna do the exact same thing to all of you! ",4,08
Bow,  I don't care.,4,08
Octavia, Hey! I'm threatening you.,4,08
Bow,  I don't care!  You know what? It's not easy being the friendly and upbeat guy all the time. And I get that it's hard being friends sometimes. You gotta work at it. ...So why am I always the only one who's willing to work at it? I mean...they didn't even notice I'm gone. ...Do whatever you want. I don't care. It's terrible being friends with friends.,4,08
Octavia,"  Oh, yeesh.  Ready at the rendezvous point. You guys gotta get this kid off my ship, he's bringing me down. ...Scorpia? ...Scorpia, come in.",4,08
Soldier," Force Captain Octavia, we got magic incoming!",4,08
Octavia,  What?!,4,08
Adora,  For the Honor of Grayskull!,4,08
Glimmer,  Look out! ,4,08
Sea Hawk,  Mermista! You're back in the game!,4,08
Mermista,  Never felt better.  Rescuing people is my jam.,4,08
Sea Hawk," I knew it! Never doubted my brilliant plan for a moment.  Oh, how fun--",4,08
Mermista, No shanties!  Hit it.,4,08
Sea Hawk,  I thought you said no shanties?,4,08
Mermista," This isn't a shanty, it's like a rock remix, so...it's cool.",4,08
Mermista,  You can't keep me down / Can't throw this princess around / 'Cause you know how this all ends,4,08
Sea Hawk,  With punches and kicks / And magical tricks / On each other we all depend,4,08
Mermista,  I'll blast you away / And fight another day / For Salineas!,4,08
Mermista and Sea Hawk,"  Yeah, it's fun to fight hard with friends!",4,08
S, Fight with friends!,4,08
M, Fight with friends!,4,08
S, Fight with friends!,4,08
Mermista and Sea Hawk,  It's hard to fight with friends!,4,08
"Bow, Sea Hawk, and Mermista","  Yeah, it's fun to fight hard with friends!",4,08
B, Fight with friends!,4,08
S, Fight with friends!,4,08
"Bow, Sea Hawk, and Mermista",  Fight with friends!,4,08
S, Fight with friends!,4,08
"Bow, Mermista, and Sea Hawk",  It's hard to fight with friends!,4,08
Catra, Scorpia?  ...Scorpia? ,4,08
Sea Hawk,  And that is the tale of how I united everyone with my brilliant plan!,4,08
Mermista," Whatever, you goober.  Your plan was terrible.  But I'm done moping in a bathtub.  I'm ready to fight, to destroy the Horde and get my kingdom back!",4,08
Sea Hawk, That's my girl!,4,08
Mermista," Also, Bright Moon ran out of ice cream.",4,08
Sea Hawk, That's also my girl!,4,08
[Both laugh; their conversation continues as Bow looks on at Glimmer and Adora; some things that can be heard are,,4,08
Sea Hawk, Sea Hawk--,4,08
Mermista, We should always fight to music. It's awesome.],4,08
Bow," Adora, you and Glimmer--",4,08
Adora,"  I know what I have to do, Bow. I'm going to look for Mara's weapon. The one she mentioned in the message. Maybe it can turn the tide of the war for us. ...It has to.",4,08
Bow," What are you talking about? Glimmer doesn't need a weapon, she needs her friends.",4,08
Adora,"  No, she doesn't.  But it doesn't matter. I will fix this...no matter what Glimmer thinks of me.",4,08
Sea Hawk,"  The Best Friends Squad on the sea / we subdued the threat / the threat with ease / we sail the world / come near or far / we're best friends we are, we are / we're best friends, we are, we are!",4,08
Bow,"  We're best friends, we are...we are...",4,08
Swift Wind," Are you sure we're going the right way? Like, 100 percent sure?",4,11
Adora,"  For the last time, I don't know. We have to trust that the navigation system knows what it's doing. Now stop asking.",4,11
Bow, We've got to be close. Any minute now. Beast Island is around here. Somewhere.,4,11
Adora, We will find it.  We have to.,4,11
Bow," Do you think Glimmer will still be upset when we get back? We did sort of, kind of, completely disobey direct orders",4,11
Adora," She'll understand. We all want what's best for Etheria. And once we get Entrapta back, Glimmer will know we made the right decision.",4,11
Bow," Right, but—I mean what if she doesn't? What if she never talks to me again?",4,11
Adora," Uh, Bow? The thing that's blinking, should it be blinking?",4,11
Bow," Uhh, I don't know, a ship?",4,11
Swift Wind," Uh, guys, I'm sensing something out there. Something big, and it's not good. And I think I hear—",4,11
Bow," Don't panic, no one panic. ",4,11
Bow," Uh, nope! Never mind, Panic!",4,11
Swift Wind, Ehh,4,11
Adora, Look. It's Beast Island.,4,11
Adora," As kids, we were warned of the dangers of Beast Island. There were the Chibbits with razor-sharp teeth, Scruffers with razor-sharp horns, Razorfins with—",4,11
Bow, Razor-sharp fins?!,4,11
Adora," Razor-sharp teeth, actually. I don't know why it had that name",4,11
Swift Wind, Adora!   Okay! That's normal.,4,11
Adora,  Entrapta. She must have been on it.,4,11
Swift Wind, Where do you think she went?,4,11
Swift Wind, What is that noise?,4,11
Bow, What noise?,4,11
Swift Wind,  It's gone  You didn't hear it?,4,11
Bow," Uh, any scary Horde bedtime stories about noises only horses can hear?",4,11
Adora, Not that I can remember.,4,11
Swift Wind," I heard the same sound earlier, right before Mara's ship crashed.",4,11
Bow," First Ones' tech. This is all First Ones' tech. But it's corrupted, melted down. This must've been some kind of First Ones' dumping ground",4,11
Adora, We should get moving while we still have light. Entrapta's here somewhere.,4,11
Swift Wind,"  On this awful nightmare island,  which we went to on purpose, so everything's great. Hey, let's take a fun stroll through nightmare island, just kidding, it's definitely not weird and scary.  I wanna go home.",4,11
Swift Wind, Maybe everything went quiet... for a good reason.,4,11
Adora," Nope, a bad reason.",4,11
Bow," Okay, no one move. Maybe it won't see us.",4,11
Adora, For the honor of Grayskull!,4,11
Adora, ,4,11
Bow, Uh... Adora?,4,11
Adora, Run!,4,11
Bow, What happened? Why can't you be She-Ra?,4,11
Adora, I don't know!,4,11
Swift Wind," There it is again, that sound.",4,11
Swift Wind," Really, no one else hears that?",4,11
Adora," No! Come on, come on. For the honor of Grayskull! ",4,11
Bow, Adora!,4,11
Man, ,4,11
Bow, Woah.,4,11
Adora," Who is that guy? Thank you, you saved us. Who—?",4,11
Bow,  King Micah.,4,11
Glimmer," Light Hope?  The queen of Bright Moon demands to speak to Light Hope. Now.  On behalf of the Great Rebellion, I need you to answer my questions.  Eternia? Okay I know you can hear me.  So that's how it is. Fine. I'll just have to make you listen. ",4,11
Light Hope,  Unauthorized presence detected. Security protocol activated.,4,11
Glimmer, You're not getting rid of me that easily.,4,11
Adora, Your Majesty,4,11
Man/King Micah, Huh? You know who I am? Please don't kneel. I'm no king here.,4,11
Adora," Of course we know. Oh, uh I'm Adora, and this is Swift Wind and Bow.",4,11
Bow," King Micah, It's so great to—  —meet you.",4,11
King Micah," Huh. Apologies. It's been... quite some time since I've talked to anyone else. Anyone real, that is. And you are real, Right?!",4,11
Bow," Very real. Huh, yeah. Hi. Uh... Are you real? I mean, we kinda thought you were dead.",4,11
Micah," If the horde had their way, I would be. They exiled me here, but I survived!",4,11
Adora," King Micah, we're from Bright Moon. We know your daughter, Glimmer.",4,11
Micah," My sweet Glimmer? Huh?  There's no time for pleasantries! We have to move quick, follow me!",4,11
Bow, Woah.,4,11
Micah," We should be able to rest here for a moment. A safe, quiet mo—",4,11
Micah, Gotcha! Oh— I'm so sorry. Where are my manners? Bug?,4,11
Adora," Uh, mmh. No.",4,11
Bow, ,4,11
Micah,"  So, what brings you to Beast Island?",4,11
Adora," Uh, We came here looking for our friend, Princess Entrapta. Any chance you've seen her? She's got purple hair and really like robots. Like, realy, really likes robots.",4,11
Micah," Yeah, I know her. She stole my rations. Only the tiny ones for some reason.",4,11
Adora," That's great! I mean, not the food part, but the other part. She's okay, or she was not long ago.",4,11
Swift Wind, Did you see which way she went?,4,11
Micah," Why yes, sh— Is that horse talking?!",4,11
Swift Wind," I can hear you. I'm swift wind, and I—",4,11
Micah, It has wings!,4,11
Swift Wind," Well, this is definitely Glimmer's dad.",4,11
Bow," Your Majesty, could you let me go?",4,11
Micah," Huh? Oh, right.  Sorry. Like I said, it's been a little while since I've talked to people, or horses. Because horses talk now, and that's normal.",4,11
Adora, You were saying something about Entrapta. Do you know where she is?,4,11
Micah, Yes. Your friend headed straight for the center of the island before I could stop her.,4,11
Bow, Sounds like Entrapta. Could you point us in the direction—,4,11
Micah, You can't go there! You'd never come back. It's where the signal is the strongest.,4,11
Swift Wind, The signal. That must be the noise I've been hearing. What is it?,4,11
Micah," You've heard it? Then we have to hurry. This place is a mass of ancient tech, mostly degraded but some of it still works. And something at the center of that island never stopped signaling. The signal dulls your resolve, exposes your vulnerabilities, it pulls you in. Everything that stays on Beast Island becomes a part of it eventually.",4,11
Bow, Why can't Adora and I hear it?,4,11
Micah," Stay here long enough, and you will. I've heard it every day, for months, years. I have no sense of time here. But I fight it! Nothing ill stop me from getting off this island and reuniting with my family. But enough about me. Tell me news of the Rebellion and Bright Moon. And my baby girl. You know her?",4,11
Adora," Glimmer? Sure. She's... Well, she's—",4,11
Bow, She's our best friend. We're the Best Friend Squad.,4,11
Micah, Sounds like my baby girl. Hm. Always in a hurry to grow up and be friends with the older kids. What about Angella? Have you seen her?,4,11
Adora," Your Majesty, I—",4,11
Bow, What is that?,4,11
Micah," We should keep moving. I'll help you find your friend, and then, can you help me escape this place?",4,11
Bow, Of course. We'll all get out of here together.,4,11
Micah, Then why are we waiting? Follow me!,4,11
Micah," So you're telling me that horses are now allowed in the War Room, and they all get chairs?",4,11
Swift Wind," Big, important chairs, yep! And also, unlimited sugar cubes.",4,11
Micah," Eh, sounds good to me. ",4,11
Adora," I can't believe Glimmer's dad has been alive this whole time. And he's so cool. A Little weird, but I guess that's to be expected after all this time alone.",4,11
Bow," Glimmer will be so happy to see her dad again. She'll have to forgive us for going against her orders, escaping Bright Moon, and taking Mara's ship. Not that we technically did anything wrong, or need to be forgiven. I mean, Glimmer kept us in the dark. The truth is she hasn't been a good friend. But have we been? Can you even have a fight with a best friend and still be best friends? And don't get me started on Shadow Weaver.  Are you okay?",4,11
Adora,"  Yeah, it's just— Why can't I be She-Ra here? What if something on this island infected the sword, or what if Glimmer is right an-an-and all I do is ruin everything? I... I just feel useless.",4,11
Bow," Hey, you aren't useless. We'll figure this out. You're still a hero, I'm still a tech master, Swift Wind's still—",4,11
Swift Wind, Woo-hoo!  That's not food!,4,11
Bow, He's still a horse. But now we've got Cool Sorcerer Dad helping us.,4,11
Adora, You're right.,4,11
Glimmer," Are you gonna send more spiders for me to destroy, or are you gonna talk to me? The First Ones stole the magic of Etheria, the magic of my people. Please, talk to me! That magic is how I stop this war. It's how I save everyone. That magic, the magic at the Heart of Etheria... I want to use it.",4,11
Light Hope,"  Temporary administrator access granted to Queen Glimmer of Bright Moon. Queen Glimmer, proceed.",4,11
Shadow Weaver, Please keep your bot out of my flower beds.,4,12
Scorpia," Oh! Oh, sorry about that.",4,12
Scorpia," Emily! Emily, come here!",4,12
Scorpia, No! Not in the skull plant things!,4,12
Scorpia," So uh, they let you have your own garden here? Aren't you a prisoner? Am I prisoner? Everyone's been so nice. How come we're not, you know, in a prison? Is this garden a prison?",4,12
Shadow Weaver," It wasn't, until today.",4,12
Scorpia," Oh! Heh, heh! Right, right, sorry!",4,12
Scorpia, I-I'm not even here! Just a garden away..,4,12
Scorpia," Emily! What did I just say? I said, stay out of the skull plants!",4,12
Scorpia," Bad bot! Bad! I said, drop it!",4,12
Glimmer, Scorpia!,4,12
Shadow Weaver," Your majesty, you're back. Did you find what you were looking for?",4,12
Glimmer," Yes. Light Hope told me everything I need to know, and I have a plan.",4,12
Shadow Weaver," A plan? Excellent, we should discuss-",4,12
Glimmer," Scorpia, I need your help.",4,12
Scorpia, Me?,4,12
Glimmer, You're the only person who can save Etheria. We need you to reconnect to the Black Garnet.,4,12
Shadow Weaver," What? Your majesty, I don't understand. We should reconvene with the other princesses and-",4,12
Glimmer, The other princesses are gone. But it's fine!,4,12
Shadow Weaver, Gone?,4,12
Glimmer, I said it's fine. I have a plan-,4,12
Scorpia, Gone where?,4,12
Glimmer," Okay, would anyone else like to interrupt me?",4,12
Gaurd," I'm sorry your majesty, but Double Trouble has escaped.",4,12
Entrapta," Wow, I can't believe we're all here on Beast Island at the same time. What an incredible coincidence.",4,12
Bow, Uh... It's not a coincidence. We came to find you.,4,12
Entrapta,"Beast Island Log, tide cycle 37. I have confirmed that the outside world still exists. I founded princesses! Well, one princess, some sort of horse bird-hybrid, Bow, and...",4,12
Entrapta, I don't know you.,4,12
Micah, Yes you do. You stole my food.,4,12
Entrapta, Oh yeah! It was delicious!,4,12
Entrapta, Wasn't there another one of you?,4,12
Bow, Yes. Glimmer. You know her. And she's... not here.,4,12
Swift Wind, Can we talk about how I'm not a bird?,4,12
Adora," Entrapta, we have been looking all over on this island for you. Are you ok?",4,12
Entrapta," Of course I'm ok! Have you seen this place? An Island, full of technological monstrosities, each more deadly than the next? Its paradise!",4,12
Bow," Yeah, um, glad you're having fun, but we're kind of here to rescue you?",4,12
Entrapta, Rescue me? Did I not just rescue you?,4,12
Adora, Yeah.. that didn't go as planned.,4,12
Bow," We came to bring you back.We would've come sooner, but we had no idea you were here. We though you were still with Hordak.",4,12
Bow, Scorpia told us what happened. She and the other princesses are waiting for you at Bright Moon.,4,12
Adora," Entrapta, please. We need your help. We discovered what the First Ones and what they were doing to Etheria, a terrible secret that no one else knows.",4,12
Entrapta, You mean The Heart of Etheria? Why didn't you just say so?,4,12
Lonnie, Sorry. We didn't know you were in here. We'll just come back later.,4,12
Catra, Wait.,4,12
Catra, What's the report from the field?,4,12
Lonnie," We just got back from conquering another rebel town! The third one this week. So, you're welcome.",4,12
Kyle," And then Rogelio, he was all",4,12
Catra, Watch it!,4,12
Lonnie, Calm down Catra! It's not like Scorpia needs it anymore.,4,12
Catra, You don't get to talk to me like that. I'm your commander. Got it?,4,12
Lonnie, What is wrong with you? We're winning! Even you should be happy.,4,12
Catra, Happy?,4,12
Catra," I'll be happy, when the Rebellion and She-Ra are gone for good! But that's never going to happen, with the three of you, goofing off all the time.",4,12
Catra, You are pathetic!,4,12
Kyle, Stay away from her!,4,12
Kyle, We used to be your friends. Why are you treating us like this?,4,12
Catra, Get out!,4,12
Double Trouble, Ouch! It's worse than I thought. You're a mess.,4,12
Catra," Double Trouble? Y-You came back? I mean, where were you? I thought um-",4,12
Double Trouble, You thought I left you?,4,12
Double Trouble," Apologies for the delay, Kitten. I got held up in Bright Moon. But don't worry, I brought something that might cheer you up.",4,12
Catra, Better be something good after all that.,4,12
Double Trouble," The time to strike the final blow to the Rebellion is upon us. The princesses aren't getting along, and most deliciously, She-Ra is gone.",4,12
Double Trouble, So..,4,12
Catra, Bright Moon is unprotected.,4,12
Double Trouble, Told you it would cheer you up.,4,12
Shadow Weaver, We must find Double Trouble at once. They know too much! We can't let them return to the Fright Zone!,4,12
Glimmer, Forget Double Trouble. They don't matter anymore. The only person we need is right here.,4,12
Shadow Weaver, Scorpia is not a true princess. She has never shown any connection to her Runestone.,4,12
Glimmer," But she will, as soon as we get her to the Black Garnet.",4,12
Shadow Weaver," Get her to the Black Garnet? Your majesty, you're not thinking this through. You cannot go to the Fright Zone now! You are without allies, without your prisoner, and without a plan!",4,12
Glimmer, I have a plan!,4,12
Shadow Weaver," My queen, listen to me. Think. Have I not only tried to help you?",4,12
Shadow Weaver, You are letting your emotions get the better of you. This plan is too risky. What would your mother say if she were here?,4,12
Glimmer," You don't get to talk to me about my mother. Besides. You, were the one who told me to decide what kind of queen I am. And I've decided. I'm the queen who's going to save Etheria.",4,12
Shadow Weaver, My queen.,4,12
Hordak, What is the meaning of this?,4,12
Catra," Oh sorry, I though you wanted to defeat the Rebellion. Because this is what that looks like.",4,12
Hordak, We are already spread thin from occupying so much territory.,4,12
Catra," We're occupying plenty. But not Bright Moon. Not yet. Double Trouble reported in. The princesses are in chaos, She-Ra is gone, and without their precious hero to protect the castle, well..",4,12
Hordak, we can strike the final blow to the Rebellion. When Bright Moon falls we will control all of Ehteria.,4,12
Catra, Big brothers going to be so impressed.,4,12
Hordak," Yes. This will show him what I am capable of. What we are capable of. Good work, Catra.",4,12
Hordak, Victory is ours.,4,12
Swift Wind," I don't like it here. The signal, it's getting louder again. I think we should go.",4,12
Micah, The talking horse is right. We should stay away. No one ever comes back from this part of the island.,4,12
Entrapta," Don't worry about the signal, it's better inside.",4,12
Bow, Inside where?,4,12
Bow, Wha-,4,12
Entrapta, Somewhere...,4,12
Entrapta, Aha! Ta da!,4,12
Entrapta, Come on! You're going to love it.,4,12
Swift Wind," Wow, this place is terrible. I hate it.",4,12
Adora, It's a First Ones Temple.,4,12
Entrapta," Isn't it amazing? The First Ones tried to their secrets by dumping them on Beast Island! The answers I've been looking for, they're all here!",4,12
Entrapta," My theories were correct. I knew the First Ones had retrofitted the planet with tech, I just didn't know why. But it all makes sense now! They were mining the planet's magic, using it to power their weapon, The Heart of Ehteria!",4,12
Entrapta," But of course you know all about The Heart of Etheria already, seeing as you're apart of it.",4,12
Adora," Wait, wait. Hang on. What?",4,12
Entrapta," All the princesses are. Hang on, I'll show you.",4,12
Entrapta," The Heart draws its power from the magic of the princesses. It needs all their Runestones engaged to work. And She-Ra is the most important piece, the key! She channels the weapon's power and focuses it.",4,12
Entrapta, She-Ra is the only being strong enough to withstand the destructive energy of The Heart.,4,12
Entrapta," So the First Ones made the sword to control her, to use her.",4,12
Entrapta," When The Heart is deployed, She-Ra will raise her sword and fire it!",4,12
Adora," She-Ra is the key.. That means I can stop it, right? If She-Ra fires the weapon, then I just won't do it.",4,12
Adora," Please, Entrapta, tell me I can stop it!",4,12
Entrapta," Once the planet is balanced, no one can stop it. Not even the First Ones could control it. That's why they left. When the weapon is activated it will channel all its power into you. You don't get to refuse.",4,12
Bow, But Etheria isn't balanced yet. Look! There's still one Runestone offline. We might still have a chance. Wait.,4,12
Bow, The Black Garnet. Scorpia.,4,12
Adora, Scorpia's with the Rebellion. You don't think Glimmer would-?,4,12
Bow, There's no way she would know Scorpia's the final piece. Right?,4,12
Adora, We have to get back to Bright Moon.,4,12
Glimmer, Scorpia! We need to go to the Black Garnet chamber now. My plan is going to work!,4,12
Glimmer, What's wrong? I thought you would want to be a princess?,4,12
Scorpia," Ok. I have been considering, I really appreciate the offer, but, I only came here to help Entratpa. I left the Horde, but I'm not gonna betray them. Or Catra.",4,12
Glimmer," This will save them. Horde Prime could be here at any moment. If he shows up and we're not ready to defend ourselves, everyone loses. Do you really think he'll need to keep Catra around?",4,12
Glimmer, We both want to save the people we love. But I can't do it without you.,4,12
Scorpia, It's hopeless.. What if the Black Garnet doesn't want me? I just.. kind of get rejected a lot.,4,12
Glimmer," Tell me about it. My best friends left me. Even before this, I was the weak princess, the one who had to recharge. Who didn't fit. But that's changed now. We've changed now. We're stronger than anyone knows. We can do this. We can save everyone.",4,12
Scorpia, Everyone?,4,12
Glimmer, You're not hopeless. You were born for this. And I'll help you. We're in this together. You're going to make a great princess.,4,12
Scorpia," Sorry, that was probably too much. Oh wow still going.",4,12
Scorpia, I'm in. So what now?,4,12
Glimmer," Now, we go to save the world.",4,12
Double Trouble, It took a while but I think I finally figured out your character  You try so hard to play the “Big Bad Villain” but your heart has never been it has it?,4,13
Catra, Huh what stop!,4,13
Double Trouble," People have hurt you  they didn’t believe in you  didn’t trust you  didn’t need you, left you  but did you ever stop to think their not the problem  it’s you; you drive them away Wild Cat.",4,13
Horde Prime, A weapon? That explains these readings. They are stronger than anything I've seen.,4,13
Bow, They took her they took Glimmer.,4,13
Adora," She-Ra's gone, the sword is broken.",4,13
Bow, So what do we do?,4,13
Adora, We're going to get Glimmer back and then we're going to save the universe.,4,13
Adora,  For Etheria! ,5,01
Bow,  Two down.,5,01
Swift Wind, And a whole Galactic Horde to go.,5,01
Mermista,"  I'll get the next one, I guess.",5,01
Adora,"  It's okay, you can come out now.",5,01
Adora,  Run!,5,01
Mermista,  My turn. ,5,01
Bow,"  Come on, let's go before they--  --Adora!",5,01
Adora,  For the honor of--  Ooooh...,5,01
Bow,  Adora!,5,01
Adora,  I'm okay! I'm okay--ow! ,5,01
Mermista,"  Adora, chill.  You're not...She-Ra anymore, remember?",5,01
Adora,  I'm on it!,5,01
Mermista,"  Ugh, I just said...",5,01
Adora, Gotcha!,5,01
Horde Prime,  Well... Who are you?,5,01
Adora,  ...What is this?,5,01
Adora,  What...?,5,01
Darla's Interface, Alert. We are being pulled in by an outside force.,5,05
Adora, You won't find anything; I came alone. I hear Horde Prime's been looking for me. Figured it was time we met.,5,05
Clone,  Yes. You will be brought before Prime. And there you will receive your judgement.,5,05
Entrapta, Spacesuit testing officially a success. All suits stood up to ship's velocity  with zero loss of life.,5,05
Glimmer,"  Wait, what? That was a possibility?",5,05
Bow,  We're in.  They didn't find us.,5,05
Adora,"  Good. Be quick, and don't get caught.",5,05
Glimmer,"  Okay, everyone, sound off. I'm heading to Horde Prime's holding cell to get Catra.",5,05
Bow,  And Entrapta and I are going to hack into the ship's server and download any intel about Prime's weak points.,5,05
Glimmer,  Look for a room with a lot of glowing tech in it. I remember them taking me past it when--when they took me to... That has to be the server.,5,05
Entrapta,"  Then that's our access point! Although, as long as we're here, you wouldn't mind if I just took a few readings----okay. To the server room!",5,05
Adora,"  Okay, uh--everyone, just be careful.",5,05
Clone,  You will go alone.,5,05
"Bow, over the radio","  You've got this, Adora. Keep him talking.",5,05
"Glimmer, over the radio","  Knowing him, that is not going to be a problem.",5,05
Adora, Prime.,5,05
Horde Prime, Welcome...Adora.,5,05
"Bow, over the radio",  Hey.  You okay?,5,05
Glimmer,  What?,5,05
"Glimmer, over the radio", You worried about me?,5,05
Bow, Maybe. Just...,5,05
"Bow, over the radio"," ...Be careful, okay?",5,05
Glimmer,  Yeah.,5,05
"Glimmer, over the radio", You too.,5,05
Entrapta,  Still no sign of the server room...  This place is so big...and empty.  Where are the vents? How does anyone get around in this place?,5,05
Bow,"  Call you right back, gotta go.",5,05
Entrapta,  That must be the server room.,5,05
Bow,  Uh...Hello. Would you believe that we're the... inspectors?,5,05
Horde Prime," Forgive my unseemly state. It is a tedious task,  but a necessary one to maintain this vessel.",5,05
Adora,  Is...is something funny?,5,05
Horde Prime,"  You are not going to use the weapon, or you would have already done so. You would never risk the safety of your Catra.",5,05
Adora,  You don't know me. And you don't know what I'm capable of.,5,05
Horde Prime,  Oh...but I do.,5,05
Horde Prime,"  I am old, far older than you can imagine. My brothers lend me their life force, and when  one vessel fails me, I simply elect another.  Thus, Prime has reigned eternal through the centuries. There is something so......familiar about you, Adora.  A face I have not seen in a thousand years.  Not since I faced your ancestors, and crushed their once-mighty empire beneath my heel. You call them the First Ones. And you are one of them,  are you not, Adora?",5,05
Bow, Whoa!,5,05
Entrapta,"  Oh, come on, baby, come on!",5,05
Entrapta,  Hordak? ,5,05
Bow,"  Entrapta, no! What are you doing?!",5,05
Entrapta,"  Hordak...  That's you, isn't it? I...brought it for you.  I thought you might need it, do you recognize it?  Do you....recognize me?",5,05
Clone," You are trespassing, Prime shall hear of this, and his punishment shall be merciless, for Prime sees all--",5,05
Bow,"  No, no!  Stay in there! ",5,05
Entrapta,"  Well that's definitely not Hordak, so we can cross that one off our list.",5,05
Bow,  I wasn't aware that we had a list!,5,05
Clone,  Where...am I? I cannot connect to the hive-mind. I am...alone?  I am alone...,5,05
Entrapta,  Uh-oh... We broke him.,5,05
Clone,  Horde Prime. How will he see my thoughts? How will he know that I am faithful?,5,05
Bow,"  It's all right. We'll, uh...we'll tell him.  O-okay, buddy?",5,05
Clone, You...you will tell him? ,5,05
Bow,  Uh...sure?,5,05
Clone,  You...know Horde Prime?,5,05
Clone,  Please...let me accompany you and prove myself worthy to Horde Prime.,5,05
Bow," No, that's--that's really okay, uh--",5,05
Entrapta, Can you open this door?,5,05
Bow,  We're not keeping him.,5,05
Entrapta,"  But we broke him! We're responsible for him now.  Plus, he can open doors...",5,05
Bow, Can you...take us to the server room?,5,05
Clone,  I would be honored to serve one who is a beloved of Horde Prime.,5,05
Bow,"  All right, then, Wrong Hordak. Lead the way.",5,05
Bow," Or...point and...I'll just keep dragging you. That's fine, too. ",5,05
Glimmer,"  Guys, I found the cell, but...Catra's not here. What do we do?",5,05
Glimmer,  Bow? Entrapta? ...Adora?!,5,05
Horde Prime," I thought the First Ones were all gone, but clearly...some faction remains. That race of tyrants...abandoned you on a forgotten planet in a shadow dimension. They made you their weapon, their...She-Ra.",5,05
"Catra, off-screen",  Adora?,5,05
Adora,  Catra? Where are you?,5,05
Horde Prime," Of course. Your Catra. She hoped you would come for her...poor thing. So all I had to was wait. As she would've said, ""You are so very predictable.""  ...Come here, child.",5,05
Chipped Catra," Hello, Adora.",5,05
Bow," Come on, Wrong Hordak. Any clue where the server room is yet?",5,05
Wrong Hordak," Forgive me, brother. The ship is designed so that it may only be navigated by one who has access to the hive-mind. ...And I have been cut-off...",5,05
Entrapta,"  There's something in here! A big energy signal, this has to be it!",5,05
Bow,"  Adora, we found it!  Adora...?",5,05
Adora,  What did you do to her?! ,5,05
Horde Prime, I have made her anew. I saw her mind......so ensnared in grief and rage and pain...and I brought her to the light. Isn't that right... little sister?,5,05
Adora,"  Catra, you have to fight it!",5,05
Chipped Catra," My place is with Horde Prime, Adora. I don't want to leave.",5,05
Horde Prime, Tell her what I've done for you.,5,05
Chipped Catra,"  Prime has given me peace. Something you could never do.  You broke my heart. But he has made it whole again. Don't you see? This is for the best. I'm happy here.  You could be happy, too.",5,05
Adora,  Let her go.,5,05
Horde Prime," Shall we make a deal, Adora?  I will give her to you, if...you want her... But first, you must do something for me. You...will give me She-Ra.",5,05
Adora,  Never.,5,05
Horde Prime, Very well. ,5,05
Horde Prime," You miscalculated.  I see all. I know all.  You thought yourself worthy to challenge me...but you are nothing but a false hero, the last of the First Ones to fall at my hands. You have led your friends to destruction. ",5,05
Horde Prime,"  Go on, fulfill your purpose.Bring out She-Ra, and strike me down.",5,05
Horde Prime,  Ah... but you two must have a lot of catching up to do. I will leave you to it. Let me know when you're ready to make a deal.,5,05
Glimmer, Hey. Remember me? ,5,05
Adora,"  Catra, listen to me. I know you're still in there.  I'm not leaving without you.",5,05
Adora, It's gonna be okay--,5,05
Chipped Catra,"  Everything is already okay. We are with Prime now. There is no need for you to suffer,  Adora. Come into the light with me.",5,05
Adora,"  Snap out of it, Catra. I don't want to hurt you...",5,05
Chipped Catra,"  ...But you have already hurt me. Prime has set me free of that pain. The pain that you caused.  He will set us all free...forever. A world of peace, without end.",5,05
Adora,  Catra!,5,05
Horde Prime and Chipped Catra,"  Oh, Adora... How long will you drag this out? You will destroy the ones you love in the process.",5,05
Entrapta,"  Horde Prime's server is infinitely more complex than anything I've ever encountered.  It's like a neural network, branching off in every possible direction in a three-dimensional configuration.",5,05
Bow,  What does that mean?,5,05
Entrapta,  It means it's gonna take a lot longer to decipher than I thought!,5,05
Bow, We have to get out of here!  Whoa!,5,05
Wrong Hordak,"  Brothers, why do you attack? We serve Horde Prime's will.",5,05
Clone,  Enemies of Horde Prime will know the terror of his--,5,05
Glimmer,"  I always hated that guy in particular. And also, all the other guys I hit on the way in.",5,05
Bow,  Glimmer!,5,05
Glimmer,  We have to get out of here!,5,05
Entrapta,  But I haven't finished yet!,5,05
Glimmer," There's no time. We might not be able to hack him,  but we can still make him hurt.",5,05
Glimmer, Let's go!,5,05
Horde Prime and Chipped Catra,"  She was afraid, in the end. And she suffered. Perhaps I will make her my new vessel...though, she would not last me long. What do you think... Adora?",5,05
Adora,"  I am not giving up on you, Catra!",5,05
Chipped Catra,  Then you're a fool. You cannot stop Horde Prime.  He will reign triumphant over all the universe. It is...destiny--,5,05
Adora, No! ,5,05
Catra,  Adora...you should have stayed away. Why did you come back? We both know I don't matter...,5,05
Adora,  You matter to me.,5,05
Adora,"  Come on, Catra! You've never listened to anyone in your life! Are you really going to start now?!",5,05
Catra,  You're such an idiot...,5,05
Adora,  Yeah...I know...,5,05
Adora, I'm going to take you home.,5,05
Catra,  ...Promise?,5,05
Adora,  I promise!,5,05
Catra,  ...Adora...,5,05
Horde Prime and Chipped Catra,  Disappointing. Some creatures are destined only for destruction.,5,05
Adora,  No!,5,05
Adora,  ...Catra?  Catra? It's okay...I'm here.,5,05
Horde Prime possessed Clone,"  I am sorry for the needless waste, Adora. It did not have to be like this. Are you ready to cooperate?",5,05
Adora, ...For the honor...of...GRAYSKULL!,5,05
She-Ra, You miscalculated.,5,05
Bow, What do we do?,5,05
Entrapta," I've got an idea, but you have to promise that you won't be mad that I  maybe, possibly,  100 percent disregarded all those times you told me not to tinker with the ship.",5,05
Bow,"  Entrapta, if you get us out of here, you can tinker with the ship as much as you want!",5,05
Entrapta,"  Great! Hey, Darla! ",5,05
Entrapta,  Good girl!,5,05
Bow,"  We need to find Adora and get out of here, now!",5,05
Bow,  She-Ra...,5,05
Glimmer,  She's back...,5,05
Darla's interface,  Shields at 30 percent. Hull compromised. Interspace travel not recommended.,5,05
Darla's interface," Administrator detected. Hello, She-Ra.",5,05
She-Ra," Hey, Darla. Get us out of here.",5,05
Darla's interface, Affirmative.,5,05
She-Ra, And Darla?  Make it quick.,5,05
She-Ra,"  Come on, Catra. You're not done...not yet.  We're going home.",5,05
Catra,"  Hey, Adora...",5,05
Hordak,  ...En...trapta?,5,05
Entrapta,"  Okay, I patched the shielding on the aft starboard ancillary booster, try it now.",5,06
Bow,  I have no idea what that is.,5,06
Entrapta," I'm working on getting the autopilot up and functional again.  Wrong Hordak, blow torch!",5,06
Bow,"  What? We couldn't just leave him behind. And he's harmless, you know, since I... kind of, you know, fried him and scrambled his brains...",5,06
Glimmer, How's Catra?,5,06
Adora,"  Good, I think. I j--I keep checking on her, but she's been sleeping for a while, do you think I should check on her again?",5,06
Bow," Adora, you should let her rest.",5,06
Adora," Right, right.  ...But what if she wakes up and needs something?  I'm j-I'm just gonna go check on her-- No, no, no, you're right. Letting her rest. ",5,06
Glimmer,"  Come on, guys. We faced Horde Prime and made it out alive.",5,06
Bow,  I honestly cannot believe it worked.,5,06
Glimmer,"  Plus, She-Ra's back! ",5,06
Bow, How did you do that without the sword?,5,06
Adora,  I don't know. I just...suddenly felt her again. Like she'd never left. Like she's been in there all along just waiting to come out...  I just have no idea how to do it again.,5,06
Glimmer, You'll figure it out. What's important is that she was there when your friends needed her.,5,06
Bow," Well, friends, and one person who threw me off a cliff once, but sure.",5,06
Glimmer," Oh, I can't believe we're finally going home! ",5,06
Bow,  Steering!,5,06
Glimmer,"  Oh, sorry! Sorry.",5,06
Bow,"  With Darla damaged, our speed's at 30 percent. If Entrapta can't fix it, it will take us a while to get there.",5,06
Glimmer, As long as we're headed towards home and away from Horde Prime...I'm happy. We deserve to celebrate...  I'm going to make us a special dinner for tonight!,5,06
Bow,  You? ...I have never seen you cook before.,5,06
Glimmer,  ...You know what? Wrong Hordak can help. I bet he knows a lot about cooking.,5,06
Wrong Hordak,  I am honored to provide nourishment for my exalted brothers.,5,06
Adora, ...I'm gonna go check on Catra again! ,5,06
Bow," Adora--!  ...Okay, I can do this.  Next stop, Etheria.",5,06
Horde Prime,  Little sister. ...Catra...,5,06
Adora,"  Hey! Hey, it's just me.",5,06
Adora, Are you...still getting the flashes?,5,06
Catra," Yes, I keep having this horrible vision of a blonde girl who thinks she's better than everyone  barging into my room all day. ...Oh, wait. ",5,06
Adora,"  ...We'll find a way to get the chip off. If you'd just...let Entrapta  take a look at it, I bet she could--",5,06
Catra,"  I don't wanna see anyone, okay?! Not you, not Arrow Boy, or Sparkles, and definitely not Entrapta.",5,06
Adora," So, you're just gonna hide in here forever? You'll have to face them sometime...",5,06
Catra,"  No, I don't.  Just--drop me off on the closest planet, I'll make my own way.",5,06
Adora,"  What, so Horde Prime can capture you again?",5,06
Catra,  I can take care of myself.,5,06
Adora,"  I promised I'd take you home, and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.  Why are you acting like this?! We saved your life!",5,06
Catra,"  I told you not to come back!  But you just love feeling like a hero, don't you?",5,06
Adora,  You'd rather I left you there to die?!,5,06
Catra,  WHAT DO YOU CARE?! I know you all hate me!,5,06
Adora,  I never hated you!,5,06
Catra, ...Then you're even dumber than I thought.  Just...leave me alone.,5,06
Adora," ...I'm such an idiot.  I thought things would be different this time, but clearly, nothing has changed.",5,06
Swift Wind,"  I'm telling you, I felt her! I did.  She-Ra is back!",5,06
Netossa,"  Oh, no you don't! ",5,06
Frosta,  Yeah!,5,06
Spinnerella,"  Huh, weird winds today...",5,06
Netossa,"  What do you think you're doing, you're supposed to be on my team!",5,06
Spinnerella," Darling, we're doing this to cheer her up?",5,06
Frosta,  I am the undefeated champion of ice ball! ,5,06
Netossa," You know that doesn't count, right?",5,06
Micah,"  Ready, kiddo?",5,06
Frosta,"  ""Kiddo""? I'm the ruler of my own kingdom, got it, old man? ",5,06
Spinnerella," Don't take it personally, Frosta's been having a rough time lately. This invasion has her pretty freaked out.",5,06
Micah,  Do kids not like me? How do I make kids like me? Is Glimmer not gonna like me when she comes home?!,5,06
Netossa," Okay, see, now it looks like you're taking it super personally.",5,06
Micah,  ...I need your help. We got word that the Horde was sighted near Elberon. We have to go check on them.,5,06
Swift Wind,"  Did you say Elberon needs help? YES!  ...I mean, boo, for them...  But they throw the best victory parties! Dibs on this mission.",5,06
Netossa," Parties? Maybe Frosta should come, too. We could all use some fun.  Hey, Frosta!",5,06
Adora,"  Catra is driving me crazy! I thought we actually stood a chance at fixing things this time. But after everything we've been through, she's still a stubborn brat! ",5,06
Glimmer, This is Catra we're talking about. Did you think she was going to just instantly  become a totally different person?,5,06
Adora," No, I just-- I thought she'd at least try.  We all risked our lives to save her, and she can't even say thank you?  Can you believe that? ",5,06
Wrong Hordak,  I believe...in Horde prime.,5,06
Adora,"  Uh...what's he doing here, again?",5,06
Glimmer," Oh, he's helping me make dinner.",5,06
Wrong Hordak,  True nourishment comes from the favor of Horde Prime.  ...Also from nutrient-rich amniotic fluid.,5,06
Glimmer,"  Yeeeaaaah, well, we're not eating that.  I think these rations were Mara's.  Does space food expire? What does this one say?",5,06
Adora,"  ""Dehydrated protein slaw.""  ...Yum?",5,06
Bow,"  Guys, you'd better get in here!",5,06
Adora, What's going on?,5,06
Bow,  Sensors picked up Horde ships on our tail. They're coming straight for us.,5,06
Glimmer," It's gotta be a coincidence, Prime can't track this ship.",5,06
Adora," Well, is there somewhere we can hide until they're gone?",5,06
Entrapta,"  Look!  It's an asteroid field.  It would be so fun--I mean, a-a great hiding spot. But, Bow said I couldn't fly into it...",5,06
Bow,"  Asteroids.  Ship, falling apart. ",5,06
Adora," Well,  nobody has a better idea, so it'll have to do.",5,06
Darla's Interface, Projected course not recommended.,5,06
Bow,  Acknowledged...,5,06
Micah,"  Hey, I've got an idea. Why don't you ride on my shoulders? Glimmer and I used to do it all the time.",5,06
Frosta,  That's little kid stuff. And I don't need your help.,5,06
Swift Wind,"  Gonna beat those bots / And smash some drones / Then eat me some ice cream cones /  Hey, where are all those drones?",5,06
Netossa, Where is anyone? I thought this town was supposed to be in danger.,5,06
Mayor of Elberon," Welcome to Elberon, rebel heroes.",5,06
Micah, We came as quickly as we could. Where are the Horde forces?,5,06
Mayor, You are mistaken. I'm so sorry we made you worry. And you came all this way...  Why don't you  stay for supper?,5,06
Micah,  Well...  I really could go for some cake!,5,06
Frosta,  Cake? Really?,5,06
Micah,  Do kids not like cake anymore?,5,06
Swift Wind,"  Oo, wait till you see this-- party...",5,06
Bow," Okay, we should be safe in here. Even if they're looking for us, we'll be impossible to spot among the asteroids.",5,06
Darla's Interface,  We have taken damage. Hull integrity at 60 percent.,5,06
Entrapta,  Horde ships coming right for us!,5,06
Adora, How did they find us?!,5,06
Entrapta,"  Horde Prime may not be able to track Darla, but something on board is sending up a trace signal. That must be what they're following!",5,06
Adora," Those flashes Catra's been getting, the signal's coming from her chip, isn't it?  Once again, Catra is ruining our lives.",5,06
Bow,"  Wait, Entrapta hasn't fixed the shields yet!",5,06
Adora,  Then try not to hit anything!,5,06
Swift Wind,  Something weird is going on...,5,06
Frosta,"  Yeah, this place is giving me the creeps.",5,06
Frosta,  Maybe it's time to go...,5,06
Micah,"  Hey, why don't we start a game of ice ball?  That should liven things up!",5,06
Micah,  My daughter's gonna hate me...,5,06
Netossa, Where have you been? You know I don't like being alone at parties. ,5,06
Spinnerella,  Something really weird just happened...,5,06
Netossa, I know. This whole place is weird.,5,06
Frosta,  We're going back. There might be someone who actually needs help.,5,06
Swift Wind,  I don't know what happened to these guys. Their last party was great. It's like they've been replaced with totally different people.,5,06
Mayor, It's getting dark outside...  You don't want to be out in the dark.,5,06
Micah,  We really should get back to camp.,5,06
Mayor, But our guest of honor hasn't arrived. Stay...and join us  in the light of Horde Prime.,5,06
Catra,"  What is she doing in here?! I told you, I want to be alone!",5,06
Adora,  Entrapta's going to remove your chip. ,5,06
Catra,  You're going to let her operate on me? She'll kill me!,5,06
Entrapta,"  Me?  Why would I wanna hurt you?  Oooh, you mean because you sent me to Beast Island, stole my work, and used it to rip a hole in the fabric of space and time? I get it.  ...HOLD STILL!",5,06
Catra,  Stay away from me!,5,06
Adora,"  Catra, Horde Prime is tracking that chip. He's coming for us right now,  so grow up and let us remove it, or we're all dead.",5,06
Adora,"  We're doing this. Then if you think hiding from the people you hurt will make you feel better, we'll drop you off and you'll never have to see us again.  ...You'll never have to see me again.",5,06
Catra," Adora, wait--  ...Please.  Stay.",5,06
Mayor,"  Come to Lord Prime's light, and you will find peace.",5,06
Micah,  Wait!,5,06
Frosta,  Stop treating me like a little kid! You don't need to protect me!,5,06
Micah," I'm not protecting you, I'm protecting them.  Horde Prime's done something to them...but they're innocent Etherians.  We can't hurt them.  You're the strongest one here. Use your power to defend the team.",5,06
Frosta,  To me!,5,06
Netossa,  What is happening?,5,06
Catra,  Wait. Not yet.,5,06
Adora," Catra, we don't have time.",5,06
Catra,"  I can help you, okay?  When Horde Prime was...using me, I felt--It's like, um... It's like all his clones are-are connected to some kind of hive mind, and I was part of it.",5,06
Adora,  Those flashes you're getting?,5,06
Catra,"  It's him. He's still in there, he can--he can see me.  But maybe I can see him, too. I can find out what he's planning.",5,06
Adora," No, you can't risk letting him back into your head.",5,06
Catra," Adora, you have to let me try. Otherwise you're gonna do something stupid and get yourself killed. Just... Just stay with me, while I do it, okay?",5,06
Catra,"  I can feel him. He's--he's angry.  He wants revenge. He wants to make you hurt, he's...attacking Etheria.  No... no, no, no, not attacking. Something new is happening...there's so much noise.  He's...  He's chipping them.  He-He's going to chip them all!  Horde Prime is taking control of Etheria!",5,06
Adora, No... He...he can't!,5,06
Catra, It's already happening. You've gotta stop him!,5,06
Bow,"  Oh, I'm losing visuals!  Where did that asteroid come from?!  Glimmer, get over there and be my eyes!",5,06
Possessed Mayor,"  My children, why do you struggle? I wish to bring peace to your planet, yet...you reject it.",5,06
Swift Wind,"  Uh--She-Ra! If you really are out there, are you getting this?!",5,06
Possessed Mayor,  Your She-Ra will not come to save you now.,5,06
Darla's Interface,  The hull has sustained multiple fractures. We will be unable to withstand another full-on strike.,5,06
Catra,"  Adora, please... I--I want to go home.",5,06
Adora,  We will.  I'm getting us out of here.,5,06
Adora,  Etheria needs us. And I won't let him hurt anyone else.,5,06
Catra, Where are you going?,5,06
Adora, To send Horde Prime a message.  For the Honor...of Grayskull!,5,06
Possessed Mayor,"  Welcome, children. You will be reborn in Prime's image.",5,06
Swift Wind,  Wh-Whoa! Did you guys see that?,5,06
Netossa, We'll be impressed later. Let's go.,5,06
Entrapta,"  Chip appears to be fused with the subject's nervous system,  leeching energy in a parasitic exchange. Extraction is going to be a delicate process.  Careful, now...",5,06
Entrapta, Sorry!,5,06
Catra,  Just get it off!,5,06
Glimmer,  Veer left. Up...up!,5,06
Glimmer," Wait, is that--? ",5,06
Glimmer,  Yeah!,5,06
Bow,  What is going on out there?,5,06
Entrapta,  Almost...  Allllmoooost...,5,06
Entrapta,"  I did it! With the chip removed from its power source,  it won't be able to signal anymore. ...Okay, gotta go check on Darla now! ",5,06
Catra,"  ...Entrapta, wait.  ...Thank you. And...I'm sorry.",5,06
Entrapta,  I forgive you.,5,06
Entrapta, Shields and autopilot are back online.  Darla just needs some time to reboot and then she'll be back to full functionality. ,5,06
Adora,  She-Ra... She's really back... Like back for real.,5,06
Bow,"  Good timing, too. We really need her. ",5,06
Wrong Hordak, Brothers.,5,06
Glimmer,  Who wants dinner?,5,06
Bow,  Glimmer...You made these?,5,06
Glimmer," Wrong Hordak helped. Everyone eat, eat!  I used to make these with my mom. She wasn't that good a cook, either, so I figured it would be hard to mess up.",5,06
Adora,  This is really good.,5,06
[They all talk over each other; some things that can be heard are,,5,06
Bow," Okay, hold up. Glimmer, this is amazing!",5,06
Entrapta," Oh, wow, this is delicious.",5,06
Adora," Wait, you made these in the oven, from dehydrated slaw? This is so good!",5,06
Glimmer," How is it? It smells good, right?",5,06
[The group begins to talk all at once again; some things that can be heard are,,5,06
Entrapta," Does this come in smaller sizes, though? It's hard for me to eat if it's too--",5,06
Bow," Did you see that asteroid that was coming right at us? Then Glimmer was like,  ""Oh, no. Bow, stop."" and then I was like, ""Okay, I'll stop."" And I pulled up, then we missed it--",5,06
Adora, This is almost better than--,5,06
Wrong Hordak, I put amniotic fluid in there. ...That was a joke.],5,06
Spinnerella,  We--We've gotta go back for them.,5,06
Micah, We will. But first we need to figure out what that was. And how to stop it.,5,06
Swift Wind," She-Ra will know. She's coming home, I can feel it. She's getting closer every day.",5,06
Frosta,  Sorry for calling you an old man. Glimmer's really lucky to have you as a dad.,5,06
Micah,  Really? You think so?,5,06
Frosta,"  Yes, but you really gotta stop trying so hard.",5,06
Netossa,"  We don't know who we can trust now.  But as long as we all stick together,  we'll get through this.",5,06
Perfuma, These flowers really bring out the color of your eyes.,5,12
Swift Wind," Bow, could you stop playing that thing?",5,12
Bow, Hey I'm still learning.,5,12
Glimmer," Well, I like it.",5,12
Bow, Hey!,5,12
She-Ra,"  Prime is getting closer everyday to figuring out how to access the Heart of Etheria. If he succeeds, he can use it to destroy worlds, galaxies,maybe even the entire universe.  The Failsafe is our only chance at stopping him. But Prime still has our friends.  His hold over them grows stronger every day they are chipped. If we don't free them now, we might lose them forever.  Prime holds every advantage in this fight. He'll be ready for us. But we have a plan. Entrapta?",5,12
Entrapta,"  I finally succeeded in cracking Prime's signal pattern. If I can get access to his Spire network, I can broadcast a jamming frequency that will disable all of the chips on Etheria, freeing everyone at once!",5,12
She-Ra," I need you all to get Entrapta to the Spire and keep Prime's forces distracted while she jams the signal. I'm gonna take the Failsafe to the Heart and destroy it, once and for all. We're going to make sure that Prime can never hurt anyone again. We're ending this today, for good. ",5,12
Sea Hawk,  Ha-cha! Friendship! ,5,12
Adora, Oh.,5,12
Bow," You weren't trying to sneak out without us, were you?",5,12
Glimmer, Any sign of Catra?,5,12
Adora, She's not coming back. Are you sure you guys should come? We don't know what to expect from the Heart of Etheria. It- It could be dangerous for you.,5,12
Bow," There's no way we're letting you do this on your own. Whatever we find, we face it together. ",5,12
Adora, For the honor of Grayskull! ,5,12
Light Hope, Warning.Planetary Facilitator Light Hope protocol offline. Manual administrator access not reccomended at this time.,5,12
She-Ra, We are friends of Mara. Now show us where the Heart of Etheria is.,5,12
Light Hope," Welcome, friends of Mara. ",5,12
Catra, Ow! What is wrong with you?!,5,12
Catra, Stop it! Stop it!  I told you I'm not going back.,5,12
Catra," You saw what happened! Adora chose Shadow Weaver, okay? Not me! Adora doesn't want me.  Not like I want her.",5,12
Adora, ,5,13
Creature, ,5,13
Catra,"   Hey, Adora.",5,13
Adora, Catra! You can't be here. It's too dangerous. Shadow Weaver?,5,13
Catra, Get Adora to the Heart. I'll take care of this thing. ,5,13
Adora," Catra, no!",5,13
Catra," I'll catch up, ok? Get to the Heart.",5,13
Adora," No, no. Catra!",5,13
Glimmer, Dad. no!,5,13
Micah," What's wrong, baby girl? I've never felt better. ",5,13
Glimmer, ,5,13
Bow,"  Scorpia, please! We're trying to save you.",5,13
Glimmer," Dad, please! It's me, it's Glimmer!",5,13
Micah," Oh, I know who you are. My daughter. The weakling. The failure. And so it ends. Pathetic. Alone. Weak.",5,13
Glimmer, Mom.  No. I'm not.,5,13
Micah, ,5,13
Glimmer, My mother raised me to be brave. My friends taught me to be kind. And I'm stubborn. I get that from you. I will never stop fighting! And I won't lose another parent!,5,13
Micah, ,5,13
Glimmer," I love you, Dad. ",5,13
Micah, ,5,13
Glimmer, ,5,13
Bow,  I've got it! ,5,13
Scorpia, ,5,13
Bow," Scorpia, it's okay.",5,13
Bow," Prime may have made you do a lot of things,but he can't turn you into something you're not. So, right now, all I need you to do is trust me.",5,13
Scorpia,  ,5,13
Bow, ,5,13
Scorpia, ,5,13
Scorpia, ,5,13
Bow, ,5,13
Scorpia," Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry.  Did I hurt you? I did not mean to do that.",5,13
Bow, Welcome back. ,5,13
Melog, ,5,13
Scorpia, ,5,13
Entrapta,  My device worked! I knew it would.,5,13
Horde Prime,  Deploy all clone battalions. Get this under control!,5,13
Bow," Hey, everyone. I'm Bow.  Prime is probably trying to get his channel back. I have to make this quick.  Prime's controlled the universe for a long time.  Right now,we're the only thing standing in the way of him controlling it forever.  You might be feeling hopeless. You might be thinking ""We don't stand a chance."" And maybe we don't.  Prime's too strong.  His army is too powerful. But that's not gonna stop us. We need to show Prime we're not afraid of him, because we have each other.  And we have love.  We can't give up. And if we go down, we go down together.  We need you. All of you.  It's time to take back our world. It's time to fight. For She-Ra, for our homes, for each other!",5,13
Horde Prime, Put an end to this mockery.  Destroy them all!,5,13
Catra, ,5,13
Creature, ,5,13
Horde Prime,"  Oh, little sister. What a shame. I had such high hopes for you.",5,13
Catra, ,5,13
Adora," No. No, wait!",5,13
Shadow Weaver, Don't lose your focus. We're so close.,5,13
Adora, ,5,13
Shadow Weaver, ,5,13
Catra, ,5,13
Adora, Catra! ,5,13
Shadow Weaver," Adora, wait! ",5,13
Horde Prime,"  So brave, risking yourself for Adora. But it will make no difference. The Heart is almost mine, and when it is, your Adora will die.",5,13
Horde Prime," So, tell me,little sister, was it worth it?",5,13
Catra, Shadow Weaver?,5,13
Shadow Weaver, Take Adora and run! ,5,13
Catra, What are you...?,5,13
Shadow Weaver," I told you to run! Now, run! ",5,13
Catra,"  Shadow Weaver, no! What are you doing?",5,13
Shadow Weaver," Please, Catra. You need to make sure Adora reaches the Heart. The magic must be set free. ",5,13
Catra, Stop it! It's going to kill you!,5,13
Shadow Weaver," It's too late for me. But you, this is only the beginning for you. I am so proud of you, Catra.",5,13
Catra,  No! No!,5,13
Adora,  Catra?,5,13
Shadow Weaver, You're welcome. ,5,13
Catra, Come on. We have to go.,5,13
Dryl Chefs, Yeah!,5,13
Horde Prime, Impossible.,5,13
Entrapta, You can't control us. You don't understand what makes us strong. And that's why you'll never win.,5,13
Adora, ,5,13
Adora, The Heart of Etheria. We made it. ,5,13
Catra, What is it? What's wrong?,5,13
Adora, I don't... I don't know. I can't transform.  It's Prime's virus. It's keeping me from becoming She-Ra.,5,13
Catra, What does that mean? Is the Failsafe not going to work without her?,5,13
Adora,  No. It'll work.  Get as far away from here as you can. I have to do this next part on my own.,5,13
Catra," Adora, what is going to happen to you?",5,13
Adora," Without She-Ra, the magic will destroy me. I'm sorry Catra. I'm so sorry.  But there's no more time. It has to end here. I can still save everybody.  It's okay. I'm ready.",5,13
Catra, No.,5,13
Adora, Catra...,5,13
Catra," No. I'm not leaving. Whatever happens, I am staying with you.",5,13
Catra, Adora?,5,13
Catra," No, no, no, no, no. No! No! ",5,13
Horde Prime, Ah. I can feel it. The Heart is mine!,5,13
Entrapta, You can't do this! The Heart's power is too unstable! It will take you and the whole universe with it!,5,13
Horde Prime," I have had enough of this chatty little rebel. Dispose of her now. My dominion was perfect. Everything was as it should be.  Everything was as it should be. And so it shall be again.  Did you not hear me, little brother? Do it now.",5,13
Hordak," I am not your brother. You made me in your image, but I am more than that.  I gave myself a name, I made a life of my own. I made...  a friend. I am Hordak, and, I defy your will. ",5,13
Entrapta,  You did it! I knew you could-- ,5,13
Horde Prime,"  Ah, little brother. So it's true. You have been thoroughly corrupted. So be it.",5,13
Entrapta, No!,5,13
Horde Prime,"  You have forced my hand.  I will unleash The Heart, and so we shall die in cleansing flame together! ",5,13
Scorpia, Whoo! ,5,13
Bow, Glimmer!,5,13
Glimmer, Bow!,5,13
Horde Prime," Rejoice, Etheria, for your end has finally come! You have chosen darkness,  and so, into darkness you shall be plunged.  The world shall end in fire.",5,13
Glimmer, Adora!,5,13
Bow, The Failsafe. It didn't work.,5,13
Horde Prime," And when the ashes scatter, at last, there will be, peace!",5,13
Catra," Adora. Adora, stay awake!",5,13
Adora, I'm sorry.,5,13
Catra, Adora! Adora! ,5,13
Glimmer, Just let me brush it!,5,13
Catra, No!,5,13
Glimmer, ,5,13
Catra, Don't let her touch me. She's gonna torture me.,5,13
Glimmer, Do you always have to be this dramatic?,5,13
Bow, Come on guys. If we are late to Scorpia's first ball she is going to kill us. ,5,13
Glimmer, Fine! You're off the hook. This time.,5,13
Catra, You coming?,5,13
Horde Prime, A beautiful wish. But there will be no future.  Not for you.,5,13
Catra, Adora!  Please! You have to wake up!,5,13
Catra, You can't give up. You have never given up on anything in your life. Not even on me.,5,13
Catra, So don't you dare start now! ,5,13
Adora, It's too late. I've failed.,5,13
Catra, No! No!,5,13
Catra, I've got you. I'm not letting go.,5,13
Catra," Don't you get it? I love you. I always have. So please, just this once. Stay! ",5,13
Catra, Stay.,5,13
Adora,"  You, love me?",5,13
Catra, You're such an idiot. ,5,13
Adora, I love you too.,5,13
Horde Prime," Cry, Etheria! Cry for Prime's mercy!  There will be no comfort for you! All the universe will be consumed in undying flame!",5,13
Horde Prime, ,5,13
Horde Prime," Though all is reduced to rubble, Prime shall rise again. So it has been, and so it always shall be.",5,13
She-Ra, No. You're Wrong. It's time for you to go. ,5,13
Hordak, I remember you. ,5,13
Entrapta," Hordak!  I'm so glad you're back! Oh, we have so much to talk about!",5,13
Micah, Glimmer?,5,13
Glimmer," Hi, Dad.",5,13
Micah, I... You... Hello. I'm your Dad.,5,13
Glimmer, Dad.,5,13
Scorpia, Perfuma! Hi. Wow you look... you look great. ,5,13
Catra," Hey, Scorpia. Look, I... Ooh there it is!",5,13
Scorpia, You know I'm a huger.,5,13
Perfuma, Princess hug! ,5,13
Entrapta, I'm so glad you're here! Oh...,5,13
Mermista," So are we all just, like, okay with this?",5,13
Bow, Look at us now. From capturing you to us now being buddies.,5,13
Catra, We did it!,5,13
Bow, This is so dope!,5,13
Madame Razz," Ah. You would be proud, Mara dearie.",5,13
Catra, Adora? ,5,13
Adora, It's over. He's gone.,5,13
Catra, Good riddance.,5,13
Bow," So, what are we going to do now?",5,13
Adora, We can bring magic back to the universe. What do you guys say to one more Best Friends Squad road trip? ,5,13
Glimmer, I'm in!,5,13
Bow, Obviously!,5,13
Catra," Of course I'm going with you, dummy.",5,13
Adora, Then lets do this. Together.,5,13
