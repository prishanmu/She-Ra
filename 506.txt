Entrapta: [announcing] Okay, I patched the shielding on the aft starboard ancillary booster, try it now.

Bow: [nervously] I have no idea what that is.

Entrapta: I'm working on getting the autopilot up and functional again. [glancing behind her; ordering] Wrong Hordak, blow torch!

[Wrong Hordak walks up next to Glimmer and Bow, happily gassing the blow torch on as Glimmer gasps in surprise]

Bow: [when Glimmer looks at him] What? We couldn't just leave him behind. And he's harmless, you know, since I...[Entrapta's welding sparks electrically, casting light on Wrong Hordak; melodramatic horror music plays] kind of, you know, fried him and scrambled his brains...

[Bridge door opens and closes in a hum as Adora walks in]

Glimmer: How's Catra?

Adora: [nervously rambles] Good, I think. I j--I keep checking on her, but she's been sleeping for a while, do you think I should check on her again?

Bow: Adora, you should let her rest.

Adora: Right, right. [pause; then, nervously rambling] ...But what if she wakes up and needs something? [begins to walk away] I'm j-I'm just gonna go check on her--[Glimmer blocks her path sternly] No, no, no, you're right. Letting her rest. [nervous chuckle]

Glimmer: [tapping Adora lightly with her fist; happily] Come on, guys. We faced Horde Prime and made it out alive.

Bow: [happily, disbelieving] I honestly cannot believe it worked.

Glimmer: [happily, loudly] Plus, She-Ra's back! [hugs Adora as she chuckles slightly]

Bow: How did you do that without the sword?

Adora: [contemplative] I don't know. I just...suddenly felt her again. Like she'd never left. Like she's been in there all along just waiting to come out... [quickly] I just have no idea how to do it again.

Glimmer: You'll figure it out. What's important is that she was there when your friends needed her.

Bow: Well, friends, and one person who threw me off a cliff once, but sure.

Glimmer: Oh, I can't believe we're finally going home! [hugs onto Bow]

[A boom as the ship shakes, and Adora yells as she loses her balance]

Bow: [at Glimmer, admonishing slightly] Steering!

Glimmer: [letting go of him] Oh, sorry! Sorry.

Bow: [a screen boops in front of him as he presses it] With Darla damaged, our speed's at 30 percent. If Entrapta can't fix it, it will take us a while to get there.

Glimmer: As long as we're headed towards home and away from Horde Prime...I'm happy. We deserve to celebrate... [excitedly] I'm going to make us a special dinner for tonight!

Bow: [disbelief] You? ...I have never seen you cook before.

Glimmer: [chuckles slightly, then exhales a tone that falters] ...You know what? Wrong Hordak can help. I bet he knows a lot about cooking.

Wrong Hordak: [as Glimmer drags him through the door; happily] I am honored to provide nourishment for my exalted brothers.

[slight pause as Bow and Adora watch them leave]

Adora: ...I'm gonna go check on Catra again! [quickly runs after them out the door as it hums closed]

Bow: Adora--! [groans] ...Okay, I can do this. [computerized hum as he presses on a screen] Next stop, Etheria.

[scene transition to another part of outer space, a few Horde ships fly in formation; a robot inside a ship watches a beeping indicator flash on a screen, whirring in confirmation; the ships speed off, engines whooshing]

[Opening theme]


[Darla, an inner room that Catra is recovering in]

[Catra grunts and pants in her sleep as she tosses and turns, voices layered on top of each other whispering as flashes of Catra's memories of her time becoming chipped are shown; Horde Prime's voice also overlays the flashes]

Horde Prime: [whispering, taunting] Little sister. ...Catra...

[Catra gasps awake, panting; she groans and puts her hands to her head; the door hisses open and she screams in fear]

Adora: [startled at first, attempting to be calming] Hey! Hey, it's just me.

[Adora walks over and half-sits on the side of the bed as Catra gulps in some air and then groans, rolling over to face away from Adora; Adora reaches out to put a hand on Catra's shoulder, but retracts it and it pats on Adora's leg]

Adora: Are you...still getting the flashes?

Catra: Yes, I keep having this horrible vision of a blonde girl who thinks she's better than everyone [half sits up to look at Adora] barging into my room all day. ...Oh, wait. [thumps herself back down on the bed]

Adora: [sighs; then, reassuringly] ...We'll find a way to get the chip off. If you'd just...let Entrapta [Catra quickly grabs a pillow and puts it over her face] take a look at it, I bet she could--

Catra: [muffled by the pillow; upset] I don't wanna see anyone, okay?! Not you, not Arrow Boy, or Sparkles, and definitely not Entrapta.

[Adora takes the pillow from Catra; Catra's head plops against the bed as she turns the other way again]

Adora: So, you're just gonna hide in here forever? You'll have to face them sometime...

Catra: [quickly, frustratedly] No, I don't. [miserably, but firmly] Just--drop me off on the closest planet, I'll make my own way.

Adora: [slightly upset disbelief] What, so Horde Prime can capture you again?

Catra: [angrily, enunciating] I can take care of myself.

[Adora exhales frustratedly; she pauses, then grunts as she flips the mattress and Catra out of the bed, making Catra yelp]

Adora: [angrily] I promised I'd take you home, and that's exactly what I'm gonna do. [incredulously] Why are you acting like this?! We saved your life!

Catra: [angrily] I told you not to come back! [stands to get in Adora's face] But you just love feeling like a hero, don't you?

Adora: [angrily, incredulously] You'd rather I left you there to die?!

Catra: [angrily] WHAT DO YOU CARE?! I know you all hate me!

Adora: [anguished] I never hated you!

[Catra exhales slightly, stunned, then walks back over to the mattress on the floor, sitting]

Catra: ...Then you're even dumber than I thought. [quietly] Just...leave me alone.

Adora: ...I'm such an idiot. [angrily] I thought things would be different this time, but clearly, nothing has changed.

[Adora walks out, steps clanging on the metal floor as Catra looks back; Catra exhales slightly as she curls into herself a little]


[Rebellion camp site]

[A fire crackles nearby as Swift Wind and Micah walk into camp]

Swift Wind: [quiet excitement] I'm telling you, I felt her! I did. [raising his wings in celebration] She-Ra is back!

[Frosta slides in the dirt and cheers as she hits an ice ball away; she runs toward a magical volleyball-type net where Netossa and Spinnerella stand on the other side]

Netossa: [catching the ball in a net] Oh, no you don't! [her net hums magically as she grunts and flings the ball]

[Frosta pants as she runs after the ball, but it clangs into the ground and she grunts and slides too late; a wind swirls and whooshes the ball into her hands, and she gasps happily]

Frosta: [raising the ball happily] Yeah!

Spinnerella: [after a look from Netossa; putting on an air of contemplation] Huh, weird winds today...

Netossa: [slightly annoyed] What do you think you're doing, you're supposed to be on my team!

Spinnerella: Darling, we're doing this to cheer her up?

[Frosta screams excitedly as she bursts in between the two riding a wave of ice, making Netossa gasp in surprise; Frosta whoops as she leaps into the air to spike the ice ball over the net, the ball heavily landing with little to no bounce on the ground; air swirls and whooshes under Frosta to let her land softly and she grunts]

Frosta: [yelling excitedly] I am the undefeated champion of ice ball! [runs off]

Netossa: You know that doesn't count, right?

[Spinnerella pulls her in for a kiss, and Netossa giggles; the ball rolls and clangs into Micah's shoe, and he picks it up]

Micah: [to Frosta, preparing to throw] Ready, kiddo?

Frosta: [annoyed] "Kiddo"? I'm the ruler of my own kingdom, got it, old man? [walks to Micah and takes the ice ball from him]

Spinnerella: Don't take it personally, Frosta's been having a rough time lately. This invasion has her pretty freaked out.

Micah: [getting increasingly more nervous] Do kids not like me? How do I make kids like me? Is Glimmer not gonna like me when she comes home?!

Netossa: Okay, see, now it looks like you're taking it super personally.

Micah: [exhales] ...I need your help. We got word that the Horde was sighted near Elberon. We have to go check on them.

[Swift Wind gallops up, kicking up dust and whinnying]

Swift Wind: [sliding to stop; excitedly] Did you say Elberon needs help? YES! [pause as everyone looks confusedly at him; backtracking] ...I mean, boo, for them... [excitedly] But they throw the best victory parties! Dibs on this mission.

Netossa: Parties? Maybe Frosta should come, too. We could all use some fun. [calling out] Hey, Frosta!

[Snow crunches as Frosta stabs an icicle as a nose into a snowman shaped like herself, causing an arm to break off, then looks over; Netossa waves her over and Frosta walks closer]


[Darla, pantry]

[Glimmer picks a box to inspect, putting it back and looking for more, as Adora paces nearby]

Adora: [groans; frustratedly] Catra is driving me crazy! I thought we actually stood a chance at fixing things this time. But after everything we've been through, she's still a stubborn brat! [at the last word, kicks over a stack of boxes, making them clatter]

Glimmer: This is Catra we're talking about. Did you think she was going to just instantly [grabs multiple boxes in her arms and gets up] become a totally different person?

Adora: No, I just-- I thought she'd at least try. [picks up a gelatin of some type, tossing it up and catching it] We all risked our lives to save her, and she can't even say thank you? [claps the gelatin between her hands; scoffing] Can you believe that? [groans and throws the gelatin away, causing it to splatter in Wrong Hordak's face]

Wrong Hordak: [gelatin moistly oozing down his face] I believe...in Horde prime.

Adora: [confused] Uh...what's he doing here, again?

Glimmer: Oh, he's helping me make dinner.

Wrong Hordak: [happily] True nourishment comes from the favor of Horde Prime. [pulls out a vial] ...Also from nutrient-rich amniotic fluid.

Glimmer: [pushing the vial away from her; elongatedly] Yeeeaaaah, well, we're not eating that. [Wrong Hordak puts the vial away] I think these rations were Mara's. [inspects a packet from her arms] Does space food expire? What does this one say?

Adora: [sighs] "Dehydrated protein slaw." [attempted enthusiasm] ...Yum?

[A monitor projects behind Adora and beeps on as Bow comes on screen]

Bow: [nervously] Guys, you'd better get in here!

[Wrong Hordak wipes some of the gelatin off his face making a slosh noise as Glimmer hands him all the packages and she and Adora walk off; Glimmer comes back with an apron that says "smooch the chef" in First Ones writing on it and places it over Wrong Hordak's neck, then walks away]

[Scene transition to Darla's bridge]

[Door hums open and Adora and Glimmer rush in]

Adora: What's going on?

Bow: [a spherical interface shows ships and beeps] Sensors picked up Horde ships on our tail. They're coming straight for us.

Glimmer: It's gotta be a coincidence, Prime can't track this ship.

Adora: Well, is there somewhere we can hide until they're gone?

Entrapta: [using her hair to walk her body near them as she lays horizontally; shrieking] Look! [she points and the monitor glitches over to show a number of asteroids] It's an asteroid field. [moves through the projection] It would be so fun--I mean, a-a great hiding spot. But, Bow said I couldn't fly into it...[retreats on her hair]

Bow: [as the monitor beeps disappearing] Asteroids. [gets up to gesture at the pulled-apart control panel] Ship, falling apart. [piece of the panel clangs onto the floor]

Adora: Well, [sighs] nobody has a better idea, so it'll have to do.

[Adora walks off and Entrapta gasps and exclaims excitedly, walking back to the control panel as Glimmer runs off elsewhere; Bow slumps back into the captain's chair and sighs deeply, pressing some buttons that beep on the armrest]

Darla's Interface: Projected course not recommended.

Bow: [groans lightly; begrudgingly] Acknowledged...

[Bow exclaims nervously as a computerized beep sounds and his arms are swathed in digital gauntlets; he yells as he is encompassed by a sphere similar to Darla's interface, chiming as it shows new asteroids popping up on screen; Bow whimpers nervously]


[Whispering Woods, near Elberon]

[Micah, Frosta, Spinnerella, Netossa, and Swift Wind make their way to Elberon; Frosta keeps jogging ahead to catch up after she falls behind a bit of the rest of the group]

Micah: [leans down to Frosta] Hey, I've got an idea. Why don't you ride on my shoulders? Glimmer and I used to do it all the time.

Frosta: [scoffs; annoyed] That's little kid stuff. And I don't need your help.

[Micah sighs dejectedly]

Swift Wind: [cantering and leaping into Elberon; singing] Gonna beat those bots / And smash some drones / Then eat me some ice cream cones / [falters as he looks around] Hey, where are all those drones?

Netossa: Where is anyone? I thought this town was supposed to be in danger.

[A door to the town's celebration hall squeaks open, and Swift Wind's ears flick; the Mayor of Elberon and a buff villager walk out]

Mayor of Elberon: Welcome to Elberon, rebel heroes.

Micah: We came as quickly as we could. Where are the Horde forces?

Mayor: You are mistaken. I'm so sorry we made you worry. And you came all this way... [small intake of breath] Why don't you [tone becomes a little darker] stay for supper?

[Swift Wind giggles excitedly and canters forward]

Micah: [contemplative] Well... [to Frosta] I really could go for some cake!

Frosta: [annoyed] Cake? Really?

Micah: [disbelief] Do kids not like cake anymore?

Swift Wind: [trots into the celebration hall as the door squeaks open; excitedly] Oo, wait till you see this--[tone falters as he and the rest of the group look at the room of villagers silently standing around in the ransacked hall] party...


[Darla, bridge]

[Darla's engine hums as it weaves in between asteroids; the Best Friend Squad and Entrapta stand on the bridge, then the ship thunders as it crashes, and everyone screams, being thrown off balance; Entrapta laughs excitedly]

Bow: Okay, we should be safe in here. Even if they're looking for us, we'll be impossible to spot among the asteroids.

[An energy beam makes a nearby asteroid explode in a boom; Horde ships' engines whir as they fire more beams that crash into the ship, causing the crew to grunt in pain; inside her room, Catra is thrown against the wall and grunts; she gasps as she gets more flashes from the chip, hyperventilating until the flashes stop with a slight whisper of voices; Catra yelps as the ship crashes around them, shaking the rest of the crew off balance and making them scream]

Darla's Interface: [as alarm beeps and monitors chime] We have taken damage. Hull integrity at 60 percent.

Entrapta: [using her hair to tap a button on the control console, causing a monitor to whir and show images of the Horde ships] Horde ships coming right for us!

Adora: How did they find us?!

[Darla's and the Horde ships' engines whir as they chase through the asteroid field]

Entrapta: [as alarm beeps] Horde Prime may not be able to track Darla, but something on board is sending up a trace signal. That must be what they're following!

Adora: Those flashes Catra's been getting, the signal's coming from her chip, isn't it? [walking to grab Entrapta by the hand and haul her away; annoyed] Once again, Catra is ruining our lives.

Bow: [nervously] Wait, Entrapta hasn't fixed the shields yet!

Adora: [growls] Then try not to hit anything!

[The door slams shut behind them as Bow and Glimmer look at each other]


[Elberon, celebration hall]

[The villagers quietly stand around smiling creepily, some robotically dancing and clapping, some kids playing with a ball rhythmically pushing it back and forth; a villager places a bowl of slop on a table in front of the Rebellion crew]

Swift Wind: [aside to the crew, nervously] Something weird is going on...

Frosta: [sighs slightly] Yeah, this place is giving me the creeps.

[A villager nearby uses her hands to toss a bowl of slop in front of other villagers, smiling creepily]

Frosta: [nervously] Maybe it's time to go...

Micah: [scoots his chair closer to Frosta] Hey, why don't we start a game of ice ball? [happily] That should liven things up!

[Frosta grunts as she pushes her chair away from the table, scraping on the floor, then walks away]

Micah: [half-sobbing] My daughter's gonna hate me...

[Netossa grunts as she tries to weave through the crowd of villagers, bumping them slightly as she passes; she sighs lightly in relief as she spots Spinnerella across the room, making her way to her]

Netossa: Where have you been? You know I don't like being alone at parties. [takes her hand]

Spinnerella: [uncomfortably stretching her neck] Something really weird just happened...

Netossa: I know. This whole place is weird.

Frosta: [as she, Micah, and Swift Wind walk to them] We're going back. There might be someone who actually needs help.

Swift Wind: [as they look around the room the people clapping, playing and acting robotically] I don't know what happened to these guys. Their last party was great. It's like they've been replaced with totally different people.

[Frosta gasps as the door squeaks and slams shut behind them]

Mayor: It's getting dark outside... [darkly] You don't want to be out in the dark.

Micah: [nervously] We really should get back to camp.

Mayor: But our guest of honor hasn't arrived. Stay...and join us [lifts her head to reveal glowing green eyes] in the light of Horde Prime.


[Scene transition to Catra's room on Darla via flash as Catra grunts and pants, gripping her head; she whines as she claws slightly at the chip on her neck, making a clinking noise; she gasps slightly as the door hisses open to reveal Adora, and Catra continues to hyperventilate; Adora drags Entrapta into the room]

Catra: [almost fearfully] What is she doing in here?! I told you, I want to be alone!

Adora: [as Entrapta uses her hair to pick up and fix the bed and frame from where it fell earlier, the frame scraping the floor slightly] Entrapta's going to remove your chip. [Entrapta closes her mask down over her face]

Catra: [exasperatedly nervous] You're going to let her operate on me? She'll kill me!

Entrapta: [confused] Me? [lifts her mask] Why would I wanna hurt you? [pauses, then in a tone of realization] Oooh, you mean because you sent me to Beast Island, stole my work, and used it to rip a hole in the fabric of space and time? I get it. [shuts her mask over her face and uses her hair to bring out several sharp tools and vials with a shing and an electric buzz] ...HOLD STILL!

Catra: [yelling angrily] Stay away from me!

Adora: [walking to Catra, cornering her; angrily] Catra, Horde Prime is tracking that chip. He's coming for us right now, [Catra grunts as she attempts to swipe at Adora, but Adora grabs her wrist and pins her to the wall] so grow up and let us remove it, or we're all dead.

[Catra breathes out as she slides down the wall]

Adora: [angrily, firmly] We're doing this. Then if you think hiding from the people you hurt will make you feel better, we'll drop you off and you'll never have to see us again. [pauses, then sighs; dejectedly] ...You'll never have to see me again.

[Adora begins to walk away as Catra exhales lightly; Catra grabs onto Adora's wrist]

Catra: Adora, wait-- [pauses, then slides her hand down to grip Adora's] ...Please. [pauses and looks up at Adora; quietly] Stay.


[Scene transition to Elberon, celebration hall; the mayor and the villagers hold out their hands and encircle the Rebellion crew]

Mayor: [voices whisper] Come to Lord Prime's light, and you will find peace.

[The villagers moan slightly, reaching for Swift Wind and he whinnies nervously; Netossa and Spinnerella use their magic to push away villagers as Netossa grunts; a villager elbows Netossa and she falls, Spinnerella cries out in distress, going to her; Spinnerella pants, trying to wake Netossa, and air whooshes as she sends a gust to knock over some villagers; Swift Wind neighs and sends a magic blast as Micah grunts and uses a magical goo to stall villagers; Frosta grunts as she headbutts a villager holding her, yelling in preparation to hit them with an icy fist]

Micah: [running to Frosta] Wait!

Frosta: [yelling] Stop treating me like a little kid! You don't need to protect me!

Micah: I'm not protecting you, I'm protecting them. [glances at villagers groaning as they struggle in the goo] Horde Prime's done something to them...but they're innocent Etherians. [Frosta's ice gauntlets shatter apart] We can't hurt them. [leaning down to her] You're the strongest one here. Use your power to defend the team.

Frosta: [nods as she runs away from the crowd; calling out] To me!

[The villagers moan as Swift Wind grunts and flies away, Spinnerella carries Netossa, panting]

[Frosta shouts as she creates an ice semi-sphere around the Rebellion crew; it is silent for a moment, until hands pound on the wall, the villagers grasping at the ice to break it apart from the outside, groaning]

Netossa: [getting up, nervously] What is happening?


[Darla, Catra's room]

[Entrapta holds a surgical saw that whirs as it comes on, then stops]

Entrapta: [to her recorder] Experiment number 982: [Adora and Catra let go of each other's hands as Entrapta moves behind Catra to look at her chip] Removal of embedded Horde chip. [excitedly] Let's begin.

[Entrapta takes off the plate covering the chip's wiring and touches at a wire with a tool, making a high pitched squealing occur and causing Catra to gasp and have flashes of Etheria and the people of Elberon]

Catra: [gasps] Wait. Not yet.

Adora: Catra, we don't have time.

Catra: [exasperatedly] I can help you, okay? [pauses, then quietly, shakily, halitngly] When Horde Prime was...using me, I felt--It's like, um...[gulps air slightly] It's like all his clones are-are connected to some kind of hive mind, and I was part of it.

Adora: [places her hand on Catra's shoulder] Those flashes you're getting?

Catra: [softly, shaking] It's him. He's still in there, he can--he can see me. [rubs at the chip; then resolutely] But maybe I can see him, too. I can find out what he's planning.

Adora: No, you can't risk letting him back into your head.

Catra: Adora, you have to let me try. Otherwise you're gonna do something stupid and get yourself killed. Just...[places her hand on top of Adora's on her shoulder; softly] Just stay with me, while I do it, okay?

[Catra tightens her grip on Adora's hand, and Adora smiles and then nods at Entrapta; Catra takes a deep breath in]

Catra: [eyes closed, flashes occurring as she speaks] I can feel him. He's--he's angry. [Catra groans in pain and Adora gasps, ready to reach out; Catra looks at Adora then closes her eyes again, gasping as more flashes happen] He wants revenge. He wants to make you hurt, he's...attacking Etheria. [voices whispering becoming louder] No... no, no, no, not attacking. Something new is happening...there's so much noise. [Catra begins to shake and Adora takes her hands] He's... [flash of Elberon villagers pounding on Frosta's ice wall] He's chipping them. [fearfully] He-He's going to chip them all! [gasps and opens her eyes] Horde Prime is taking control of Etheria!

Adora: No... He...he can't!

Catra: It's already happening. You've gotta stop him!

[A large boom shakes the ship, making Catra yelp and Adora grunt as she grabs onto Catra and holds her close, Catra reciprocating; in space, Darla whooshes past as the Horde ships follow, the ships firing blasts that hit Darla, exploding on impact; Bow groans on the bridge]

Bow: [as multiple screens whir to life around him; nervously] Oh, I'm losing visuals! [gasps as the ship crashes off an asteroid] Where did that asteroid come from?! [as he swipes away at the screens, beeping] Glimmer, get over there and be my eyes!

[scene transition to Elberon, where the mayor and villagers burst through the ice wall with the sound of glass shattering]

Possessed Mayor: [voice overlayed with Horde Prime's] My children, why do you struggle? I wish to bring peace to your planet, yet...you reject it.

Swift Wind: [nervously; calling out to the heavens] Uh--She-Ra! If you really are out there, are you getting this?!

Possessed Mayor: [backing away as villagers burst through the shattered entrance] Your She-Ra will not come to save you now.

[Villagers moan as they surge forward, grabbing onto Frosta as she gasps and grunts, struggling as Spinnerella and Micah grunt and attempt to free her]

[Scene transition back to Catra's room inside Darla, the ship shaking and Entrapta vocalizing nervously]

Darla's Interface: [as Adora and Catra separate, groaning, and an alarm blaring] The hull has sustained multiple fractures. We will be unable to withstand another full-on strike.

Catra: [imploring] Adora, please... I--I want to go home.

Adora: [firmly] We will. [embracing Catra] I'm getting us out of here.

[The ship shakes as outside a Horde ship blasts away; on the bridge, Bow shouts in effort as he motions the ship forward with his simulated gauntlets]

[Scene transition to Elberon, where the villagers moan and Micah groans as he and Frosta struggle and are separated from each other]

[Scene transition back to Catra's room inside Darla]

Adora: [resolutely; getting up and walking away] Etheria needs us. And I won't let him hurt anyone else.

Catra: Where are you going?

Adora: To send Horde Prime a message. [she stops and concentrates, holding her hand out, making a magical force chime and shine, forming her sword; yelling] For the Honor...of Grayskull!

[New She-Ra transformation sequence; her new attire shows traits from each of her best friends, Catra, Glimmer, and Bow; Catra blushes as she looks on]

[She-Ra walks out to the bay door, and it opens to show the multiple Horde ships outside; She-Ra yells as she goes out]


[Elberon, celebration hall]

[Villagers moan as they swarm the Rebellion crew; Netossa grunts as villagers tackle her, and Spinnerella yelps as two more tackle her when she runs to Netossa]

Possessed Mayor: [voice overlayed with Prime's; walking to cup Frosta's face] Welcome, children. You will be reborn in Prime's image.

[A light suddenly erupts behind Frosta and the Mayor shouts in pain, shielding her eyes; villagers shield themselves and cower when Swift Wind is encompassed in light and cheers]

Swift Wind: [light dying down; in disbelief, excited] Wh-Whoa! Did you guys see that?

Netossa: We'll be impressed later. Let's go.

[Swift Wind gallops after everyone as they leave, and the Possessed Mayor growls]


[Darla, Catra's room]

[The ship shakes and booms as Entrapta carefully attempts to pluck at Catra's chip]

Entrapta: [to her recorder] Chip appears to be fused with the subject's nervous system, [uses hair to wipe her brow] leeching energy in a parasitic exchange. Extraction is going to be a delicate process. [a wire makes a rubber-y stretch noise as she pulls at it] Careful, now...

[Entrapta uses a tool to zap through the wire, but it cuts just as the ship shakes, causing Catra to yelp in pain]

Entrapta: Sorry!

Catra: [angrily] Just get it off!

[The ship continues to shake and crash as Horde ships follow, whooshing through space; a Horde robot analyzes its screen as She-Ra lands heavily with a metallic thud on the nose of its ship; the bot enlarges the image of She-Ra on his screen with a chime]

She-Ra: Tell Horde Prime: this is from me! [shouts with effort on the last word, using her sword to carve into the metal of the ship]

[The ship explodes and She-Ra leaps away, more ships whooshing after]

Glimmer: [to Bow] Veer left. Up...up!

[The controls whir as Bow steers; Glimmer notices a light bouncing between asteroids, whooshing as ships follow]

Glimmer: Wait, is that--? [giggles as she watches]

[She-Ra lands on an asteroid and glares up at the ships as they whoosh past, then turn to face her; they fire blasts that She-Ra counters and uses to charge her sword, shouting as she sends the blast back at a ship to make it explode; She-Ra jumps to a different asteroid, grunting and jumping away just as a ship charges and blasts, making the asteroid erupt in flames; the ship keeps firing and destroying as She-Ra leaps toward it, shouting and finally landing on the ship and stabbing through to the robot inside; she swipes up and cuts the ship in half; a blast from below as a robot gets out almost hits her, but she shouts and swipes a blast of magical energy at the ship]

Glimmer: [cheering] Yeah!

Bow: [nervously] What is going on out there?

[She-Ra forms a magical platform beneath her, then hops from it to the top of Darla; She-Ra charges a blast, then swipes magical energy to explode the rest of the ships around them]

[Scene transition back to Catra's room]

Entrapta: [clinks as she picks at Catra's chip] Almost... [elongates] Allllmoooost...

[Entrapta pulls the chip off Catra and the wires disconnect as a whirring, powering down noise is heard]

Entrapta: [as Catra rubs at the back of her neck; excitedly] I did it! With the chip removed from its power source, [drops the chip clinking into a vial] it won't be able to signal anymore. ...Okay, gotta go check on Darla now! [begins to walk away]

Catra: [after a pause] ...Entrapta, wait. [quietly, with tears in her eyes,sincerely] ...Thank you. And...I'm sorry.

Entrapta: [walks back over to pat Catra on the head with her hair, leaning down to look at her] I forgive you.

[Catra stunned and then smiles]


[Darla, bridge]

Entrapta: Shields and autopilot are back online. [slides out from under control panel, wiping her hands off] Darla just needs some time to reboot and then she'll be back to full functionality. [walks to where Bow and Adora are laying on the floor]

Adora: [wondrous] She-Ra... She's really back... Like back for real.

Bow: [breathes out, relieved] Good timing, too. We really need her. [Entrapta lays down with them]

[They all look up as the door hums closed and Glimmer and Wrong Hordak walk in holding steamed buns on trays]

Wrong Hordak: Brothers.

Glimmer: [happily] Who wants dinner?

[Wrong Hordak sits down a tray that clanks on the ground, buns hissing with steam]

Bow: [happily surprised] Glimmer...You made these?

Glimmer: Wrong Hordak helped. Everyone eat, eat! [chuckles; Entrapta and Adora crawl over and grab some buns] I used to make these with my mom. She wasn't that good a cook, either, so I figured it would be hard to mess up.

Adora: [muffled, her mouth full] This is really good.

[They all talk over each other; some things that can be heard are:

Bow: Okay, hold up. Glimmer, this is amazing!

Entrapta: Oh, wow, this is delicious.

Wrong Hordak laughs]

Adora: Wait, you made these in the oven, from dehydrated slaw? This is so good!

[The door beeps and hisses open as Catra walks in, the door thumping shut behind her; she walks up to the group and silently sits behind them, knees pulled into herself; Glimmer and Bow share a look, then smile as they scoot apart to make room for Catra, who crawls forward to sit between them; Glimmer hands her a steamed bun and Catra looks up at Adora, who smiles at her, and Catra smiles back, taking a bite]

Glimmer: How is it? It smells good, right?

[The group begins to talk all at once again; some things that can be heard are:

Entrapta: Does this come in smaller sizes, though? It's hard for me to eat if it's too--

Bow: Did you see that asteroid that was coming right at us? Then Glimmer was like, [impersonates Glimmer in a high pitch] "Oh, no. Bow, stop." and then I was like, "Okay, I'll stop." And I pulled up, then we missed it--

Adora: This is almost better than--

Wrong Hordak: I put amniotic fluid in there. ...That was a joke.]


[Whispering Woods]

[The Rebellion crew walks toward their camp]

Spinnerella: [nervously] We--We've gotta go back for them.

Micah: We will. But first we need to figure out what that was. And how to stop it.

Swift Wind: She-Ra will know. She's coming home, I can feel it. She's getting closer every day.

[Micah pats Swift Wind]

Frosta: [to Micah] Sorry for calling you an old man. Glimmer's really lucky to have you as a dad.

Micah: [hugging onto Frosta] Really? You think so?

Frosta: [muffled in his hug] Yes, but you really gotta stop trying so hard.

[Spinnerella laughs]

Netossa: [somberly] We don't know who we can trust now. [reassuringly] But as long as we all stick together, [takes Spinnerella's hand] we'll get through this.

[Spinnerella's hair swishes aside to reveal a chip on her neck]
