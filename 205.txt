Entrapta: Hi, Catra! Did you have a nice nap?

Catra: [groans, slams hand down on table] Why is this taking so long? You said there was a First Ones weapon here. Where is it?

Entrapta: I never said "weapon", I said there's a piece of First Ones tech buried deep under the ice [pushes off the table and spins her chair back, excited] and a really powerful one at that! With the energy levels we picked up, it must have been part of the First Ones supercomputer.

Catra: [Entrapta continues to type] Just...keep digging. [enunciates] Hordak is not going to be happy if we waste his time and come back empty-handed.

Entrapta: [half scoldingly] A scientist never returns empty-handed. [excitedly flourishes with her hair and arms] There's always data!

Catra: [unamused] I'm not here freezing my tail off for data. Find me something useful, or we're packing up and heading home. [begins to walk away, scene transitioning to outside the base where the blizzard is whistling] This place gives me the creeps.

[Outside the base in the blizzard, a creature crashes through the snow, roaring and writhing]

[Opening theme]


[On the ocean, the ship called the Dragon's Daughter Five skims the water; Sea Hawk and the BFS are aboard]

Sea Hawk: [proudly] The Dragon's Daughter Five! She cuts a fine line on the sea, does she not?

Bow: Wait, what happened to the Dragon's Daughter Four? ...Oh, oh, oh! Was it [puts on an air] adventure?

Sea Hawk: [sadly] No. Termites. I couldn't save the old girl. [more chipper] Anyway, I'm honored to be a part of another daring mission for the Rebellion!

She-Ra: Well, you know, we needed a boat to get up here, and you...have a boat.

Sea Hawk: [triumphantly] Yes, I do! [chuckles slightly, then more downtrodden] Truth be told, I was...glad to have something to do. Mermista canceled our plans this week and she's hanging out with her other friends, and didn't invite me to join, I...

[Glimmer teleports next to him and he gasps]

Glimmer: [supportively] Well...let this mission distract you from all that. ...We've received reports of Horde activity from the Northern Reach. They've set up some kind of outpost, but we have no idea know why.

Bow: The Northern Reach is nothing but snow and ice. What could they possibly be doing?

She-Ra: I don't know, but it can't be good.


[The Horde Base, lab]

[Scorpia steps and peers around a container at Catra, who groans and jumps from container to container, opening one up that squeaks]

Scorpia: [to herself] Okay, Scorpia, get your head in the game, alright? You've got this. You and Catra have a special bond, and deep down in her heart [scoffs confidently] she knows that.

[Scorpia takes a deep breath out in preparation, and walks over to Catra who is still looking through the boxes]

Catra: Scorpia, good, you're here.

Scorpia: Yes, I am.

Catra: [disdainfully] Entrapta brought all this junk from her lab. Help me find a space heater or something, since apparently, we live here now.

[Scorpia steps forward slightly]

Scorpia: [slowly] So, I've been thinking, and...I know you've been really busy and focused on your career, lately, but...would you...ever want to...you know, like [sighs slightly]...hang out sometime? ...With me?

Catra: [seemingly unaffected] What are you talking about? We are hanging out. Right now.

Scorpia: Yes. Totally. Totes. But uh, what I meant was [chuckles nervously] outside of office hours? You know we could [blows raspberry, voice trembling more as she talks] I don't know, umm...play a board game or...do some other type of bonding [jostles box noisily as she attempts to lean a claw on it] activity? [laughs nervously, then exclaims when she knocks the box over, causing the First Ones tech disc to clatter out onto the floor]

[Catra picks it up, it shines with a digital whoom; Entrapta rushes over and Catra stops her from grabbing the disc by putting a hand on her face]

Entrapta: [exclaims nervously] Aaah, careful with that! It's a rare First Ones artifact! I've been meaning to study it, but I haven't gotten the chance yet. The last time I deployed it, it ended up infecting my robots with some kind of...murder-virus.

Catra: [incredulous] You brought along a murder-virus, and not a blanket?

Entrapta: [unfazed] Oh, it does other things, too. For example, when it infected She-Ra, she lost her powers. [Catra reexamines the disc in her hand, claws clanking on it slightly] Also, she got very floppy.

Catra: [eager] A She-Ra off-switch, huh? Why didn't you say something sooner?

Scorpia: So, anyway, in non...She-Ra business, [chuckles nervously] when I said we could do something--

[An alarm blares in the base and Entrapta gasps]

Entrapta: Uh-oh.

Catra: [annoyed] What?

Entrapta: [chuckles nervously] It's just a small bump. I'm sure it's fine, but...our drilling bots have gone offline. All of them. At once. [excitedly] ....Come on! We should go check this out. [walks away]

Catra: [groans] I hate this place. [follows Entrapta; Scorpia's shoulders fall and she follows]


[Outside in the Northern Reach, the blizzard roars on; Sea Hawk and the BFS walk in the snow]

Sea Hawk: [echoing] Come to think of it, Mermista never invites me to hang out with her other friends. I mean, [scoff-laughs, haltingly] am I not cool enough, for them? I'm so cool. I'm Sea Hawk!

[Bow's tracker pad whirs; Sea Hawk grunts when he bumps into She-Ra, who is kneeling and scanning the ground]

Glimmer: [calling out over the storm] What's wrong? Did you see something?

She-Ra: No, I think there's something else out here.

Sea Hawk: [puts on a tone of storytelling] You know, they say all sorts of strange things happen in the Northern Reach. Voices in the wind. Monsters in the snow. Machines break down. Sailors disappear [whispers] without a trace. [shouts] We could be next! [normal voice, slightly concerned] ...I am cool, right? I am. Right?

Bow: [sighs] My tracker pad's been on the fritz ever since that rogue communications hub messed with it. I'm having trouble pinpointing the Horde's location.

Sea Hawk: Worry not. We'll follow our [shouts] instincts! [points] This way!

Bow: Or, there's this new signal, now. It's big. It looks like a First Ones tech signature.

She-Ra: That's where the Horde will be.

[Sea Hawk grunts and hums to himself, redirecting his pointing as he walks to follow the others]


[Outside the Horde base, the bridge above the chasm where Entrapta's bots are drilling]

[Super Pal Trio stand on the bridge looking down]

Entrapta: [echoing] Ah! Here we go. Well...the drilling bots are gone.

Scorpia: [gasps] What? They just disappeared into thin air?

Entrapta: [wondering] Maybe there's scientific truth about the rumors of strange happenings in this region...

Catra: [slightly angrily] We weren't sent here to chase rumors. Hordak wants [pokes at Entrapta's chest] tech. If your bots can't dig it out, then maybe I'll send you down there to--

She-Ra: [shouts] Catra.

[the blizzards whistles by and reveals the BFS and Sea Hawk on the bridge]

She-Ra: It's been awhile.

Catra: [smugly] Hey, Adora.

She-Ra: [voice pitches up in mock consideration] You're pretty far from the front line. I guess Shadow Weaver's keeping you away from the action since you lost the Battle of Bright Moon.

Catra: [amused] Shadow Weaver? [almost chuckle] Wow. I always forget how clueless you are.

She-Ra: [raises sword] We're here to take back this land. It's time for you to go back to the Fright Zone.

Catra: [almost manic] You want us to go?! Try and make us.

She-Ra: My pleasure.

[She-Ra leaps forward and crashes her sword down as Catra dodges; Catra runs and She-Ra chases after, respectively grunting and hissing; Bow readies his Bow with an arrow and Glimmer charges her fists]

Sea Hawk: [pointing his laser sword] Adventure!

Scorpia: [puffs out air, pouting] This is not how this night was supposed to go!

[Scorpia grunts, leaping into the air to land on Sea Hawk; Glimmer grunts and summons her staff to fire sparkle bombs at Scorpia's face; Scorpia blocks and rushes to grab Glimmer, shouting as she's whipped down into the chasm; Glimmer shouts when she sees two pairs of eyes in the dark and teleports back to land, sighing in relief; Sea Hawk and Scorpia fight, sword hitting claw, both grunting]

Sea Hawk: [grunting with effort, pushing against Scorpia] Hey, while we're here, would you describe me as cool? Be honest, now.

Scorpia: [grunting with effort] Potentially! [breaks Sea Hawk's guard]

Bow: [chasing after Entrapta as she whips herself around the bridge, using her hair; shouting] Entrapta! Whatever you're doing here has to stop! You don't understand the forces you're messing with!

Entrapta: [shouts back] I know! That's the fun of it!

[She-Ra transforms the sword into a staff, grunts as she swings at Catra, who grunts and dodges; Catra runs when She-Ra lodges the staff into a rock; She-Ra transforms the sword into a rope, throwing it and ensnaring Catra's foot, who shouts when she hits the ground]

She-Ra: [transforming the sword into a sword, pointing it at Catra] Don't move!

Catra: [smugly] Oh, please. You'd never have the guts. [She-Ra reluctantly withdraws her sword with a shing] You know, as much as I love our fights, it's way too cold for this. Why don't we try something new?! [Catra pulls out the disc and touches the sword with it]

[The sword grows red veins and She-Ra cries out as waves of energy erupt from the sword; Glimmer teleports next to them]

Glimmer: [angrily] Catra, what did you do?!

[From now on, all She-Ra moments are Infected She-Ra--her voice is slightly layered]

[Infected She-Ra screams and runs at Catra; a rock crumbles when she swings at Catra who yelps and jumps out of the way; Glimmer teleports out of the way as She-Ra swings and breaks more rocks]

Catra: [running over to Entrapta and Scorpia, a little breathless, panting] You said she'd be powerless.

Entrapta: She will be. Eventually. I think.

Catra: Actually, this is pretty cool.

[Glimmer continues to teleport out of the way of She-Ra's strikes, She-Ra still screaming in rage]

Glimmer: I know you're still in there, Adora! You've got to snap out of it! Let go of the sword. You're gonna be okay, I promise!

[She-Ra grunts as she elbows Glimmer and she grunts falling to the snow]

Bow: [shouts] Glimmer! [shoots a net arrow at She-Ra, which makes a whip sound effect as it ensnares her]

Sea Hawk: [as he and Bow help Glimmer to her feet; nervously] What is happening?!

[She-Ra breaks the net and screams, charging and swinging at the three, slamming her blade down and lodging it in the ice as they teleport away; She-Ra screams and electricity sizzles around the blade as she struggles and finally frees the sword, sending a shockwave of ice out; the ice underneath the trio cracks and collapses as they scream and fall; She-Ra pants]

Catra: [amazed] This is the greatest thing that's ever happened.

[She-Ra lifts the sword in a metal clang, then grunts and rushes to the Super Pal Trio, shouting and swinging her sword at Catra; Entrapta laughs as Catra grunts and doges She-Ra's strikes; Catra blinds She-Ra momentarily with snow to the face; Catra attempts to flip over She-Ra, but She-Ra grabs her ankle and slams her down to the ground; Catra gasps, and She-Ra laughs maniacally as she lifts her sword]

Catra: [desperately] Adora! Wait!

Scorpia: [angrily, growling] Stay away from her! [tackles She-Ra, the sword lands in the snow next to Catra as she gasps]

[She-Ra transforms back into Adora as Scorpia holds her back, Adora groans slightly, but is unconscious; Entrapta walks over on her hair]

Entrapta: [shouts excitedly] Oh! I get it now! The sword got infected, not Adora herself. Huh. I guess she really is organic matter.

Scorpia: [concerned] Catra, are you okay?!

Catra: [walking over, laughing] That went so much better than I could've ever hoped. [brings the sword down from her shoulder in a metallic shing, lifting Adora's chin with the end of the hilt; softly and smugly] Looks like you're mine now, Adora. [letting Adora's chin fall and walking away; seriously] Come on, get her inside.

[The blizzard continues to roar as a creature peeks up in the distance, clicking and whirring as red veins branch out around its eyes]


[Somewhere nearby in the Northern Reach]

Bow: [calls out] Is everyone okay?

[Sea Hawk grunts as he and Glimmer push out from under some snow]

Sea Hawk: [voice cracking] Well, I for one, am shocked and terrified. What happened up there?

Glimmer: It's Entrapta's disc. It infected She-Ra once before. We've got to get to Catra and destroy it for good.

Sea Hawk: [determined] Okay. Let's go, Glimmer. Teleport us up there. [shouts] Adventure!

Glimmer: [groans] I can't. I exhausted my magic in the fight. Until I can recharge, we're climbing.

Sea Hawk: [slightly scolding] Well, that's terribly inconvenient. Shouldn't you keep better count, or something?

Glimmer: [groans in frustration; angrily pouting] I hope Catra survives She-Ra so I can wipe that smirk off her face myself.


[Horde base, the lab]

Catra: [smugly to an unconscious Adora] Always so perfect, look at you now. You're coming back to the Horde, under my command.

Scorpia: So we're, uh, keeping her...?

Catra: You saw her out there. [picks up sword] As long as we have this sword, we have the power to make her go berserk. We can turn the Rebellion's own hero against them. That's good. [to Adora, smugly] I wonder which of your friends I'll have you annihilate first... [chuckles]

Scorpia: [laughs nervously]

Entrapta: [typing away] It looks like the bots were able to pinpoint the First Ones tech before they disappeared. If you just give me a little more time.

Catra: [groans lightly] Ugh, hey. This dumb mission is over. We have what we need right here, the ultimate weapon. Pack up. We're taking her back to the Fright Zone.

Entrapta: [turns and stops typing] But...Hordak wanted us to--

Catra: Oh, wanted us to dig a useless hole for nothing? Forget it, I'm bringing She-Ra back.

[Both gasp as an alarm wails]

Catra: [annoyed] I'll go. It's probably just more Rebel idiots. Scorpia, keep an eye on Adora.

Scorpia: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I will absolutely look after this sleeping, non-moving person. [looks down to see Adora gone] Uh...

Entrapta: [still typing, pointing with her hair] She went that way.


[Nearby in the Northern Reach, on a cliffside]

[The blizzard still roars; Sea Hawk, Glimmer, and Bow climb up the cliffside]

Sea Hawk: [slightly echoing] I'm a pirate! Pirates are the definition of cool. Although, you would think that I'd get invited to more parties...I mean, you think I'm cool, right?

[Sea Hawk shouts as he loses his grip and waves his arms about, screaming as he falls; Bow shoots out a rope arrow that secures around Sea Hawk's shoulders, making him grunt as he stops falling; he sings mournfully]

Sea Hawk: I'm Sea Hawk, I am, I am / Want to take a guy for granted, then I am your man [Bow grunts as he heaves Sea Hawk up to a ledge] / Unappreciated in all I do, why can't they see, I'm very cool / Guys, back me up, I'm very cool!


[Inside the Horde base]

Scorpia: [annoyed, ruefully] Just wanted a moment alone with Catra, but, no, I'm stuck babysitting her ex-best friend.

[a silhouette of Adora runs past, then a crash is heard; Adora yells out as she slaps Scorpia in the face with a mop which makes a wet, gushing noise; Adora then laughs and falls to the ground]

Scorpia: [confused] Uh...you okay, there, Adora?

Adora: [happily, loudly] Wow. You...are a big bug. [falls back against the floor]

Scorpia: [sighs] Whew, yep. That is the truth. Glad you're seeing clearly. Now, come on. [begins to drag Adora by the hand, her body squeaking across the floor as she hums happily] I'm taking you back to the lab. [groans slightly] Aw, now what was the code again? ...Uh, maybe--[taps at the keypad with a claw]

[Adora reaches up and presses a button, mimicking beep noises by saying boop; she does this several times as Scorpia attempts to stop her]

Scorpia: Stop that.

[Adora appears on Scorpia's back and boops the buttons again until Scorpia grabs and throws her away with a thud]

Scorpia: Okay, wait, I'm pretty sure it was--

[Adora pops into frame again and boops the buttons again with more exaggerated noises and a red light beeps on; Scorpia grabs her hand and moves her away, blocking her]

Scorpia: [frustratedly] Don't, don't! Stop! Why are you making this so much harder for me? Please. [voice cracking] Please! I'm a woman on the edge! I've had a real challenge of a day!

[Adora chuckles slightly as she dips around to boop more buttons, Scorpia whips her away as a green light dings on and the door opens]

Scorpia: [quietly, confused] How did you do that?

Adora: [sitting cross-legged on the floor] I put in Catra's favorite number. [chuckles in her nose, tapping her legs on the floor]

Scorpia: [groans] Ugh, I get it. You know Catra's favorite number and I don't. Rub it in my face, why don't you?

[Metal crashes as the hallway is ripped away; the blizzard rages outside their room]

Scorpia: Uh...that's not good.

[Adora laughs as she trots out into the snow, humming in effort as she tries to catch some on her tongue; a creature whirs in the distance; Scorpia gasps and runs out to grab Adora as she continues to laugh slightly; the creature hisses and whirs as Scorpia tosses Adora into the room, at which Adora shouts; the creature hisses and Scorpia closes the door]

Scorpia: Change of plans, how about we stay inside?

Adora: [yelling happily, slurred] Yay, it's a girl's night in! [snores slightly as she falls into Scorpia's arms; her body squeaks sliding down to the floor]


[Nearby in the Northern Reach]

[The blizzard continues]

Bow: [yelling over the storm] Any sign of She-Ra? Preferably the version of her that won't throw us off a cliff?

Glimmer: [nervously] Uh, no...no She-Ra...Just a terrifying snow monster!

[A creature slithers around the base, whirring; the group gasps and turns to a creature behind them, which roars; the group screams and runs away, the creature crashing through ice after them]

[Scene transition to inside the closet with Scorpia and Adora; monstrous roars can be heard outside]

Scorpia: [groans, frustrated] Can't believe I'm stuck in a closet here with you. I should be by Catra's side, protecting her. Why can't you just stay out of our way? [kneels with Adora in tow]

[The door opens to Sea Hawk with goggles on and the blizzard]

Scorpia: [hopeful, gasps] Catra? [Sea Hawk pants heavily and pushes up his goggles] ...Inspector Pirate? [Adora waves and giggles]

Sea Hawk: [in relief] Adora! [clears his throat, voice breaking slightly] I'm here to rescue you!

Adora: Uh...more like I'm here to rescue you. [laughs and snorts slightly, falling over in Scorpia's hold]

Sea Hawk: That doesn't make any sense. Is she all right?

Scorpia: I don't know, but she is getting on my last nerve, and she is not going anywhere.

Sea Hawk: We'll see about that! En garde!

[Sea Hawk lunges for Adora and grabs her while Scorpia hangs on; both grunt as they tug her back and forth]

Adora: [touching their faces when they get closer; almost happily sobbing] Aw...you guys are my best friends!


[Inside the base, a hallway]

[Catra walks through as the alarm blares; the alarm suddenly shuts off and the metal around her rattles; the wall suddenly juts out, screeching, as if something hit it as a monster growls]

Catra: [groans] I really hate this place... [she runs back the way she came as the monster roars and pounds on the metal]

[scene transition to inside the lab]

Catra: [running to Entrapta] What's happening? Why is the power going out?

Entrapta: [her monitor shows four of monsters doing various things outside the base; speaking quickly] Apparently, by drilling into the ice, we've unleashed these creatures and now they're obsessively trying to destroy us. [shouts excitedly] What an unexpected twist! [spins around in her chair]

[scene transition to outside the base]

[Bow and Glimmer hide from a creature]

Glimmer: [whispering exasperatedly] Where did these things come from?!

Bow: [whispers] I'm guessing it's something to do with that giant pit Entrapta dug.

Glimmer: [peering up over the rock, gasping at the monster's veiny eyes; whispering] Bow, their eyes! They're red, just like She-Ra's! Do you think...maybe the monster's have been infected, too. [shouts, groaning] UGH! Catra is the worst!

[Both gasp as a monster hisses overhead, then roars]

Bow: [nervously] Uh, think you have one teleport left?

Glimmer: [nervously] Hope so!

[They teleport away just as the beast crashes face first into the snow where they were; they appear in the lab behind Catra; the monitors/machinery whir and beep as Entrapta and Catra stare at Glimmer and Bow in silence; Glimmer opens her eyes and then taps Bow's arm to make him look up]

Entrapta: [happily, elongated] Hi!

[Bow gasps as he fires an arrow at Catra and Glimmer powers up her fists, Catra grunts as she dodges; Entrapta lets out an "Ow!" as she is hit by the arrow, encasing her in some type of cloth; Catra lands on top of a container]

Entrapta: [rolling on the floor, picking at the cloth-material with her hair; wondrous] Fascinating...


[Inside the closet]

Sea Hawk: [with effort] Hand. Her. Over!

[Adora giggles slightly as she's pulled toward him, then Scorpia]

Scorpia: [angrily] Let go! Catra entrusted me with watching her, I can't let her down.

Adora: Catra... [chuckles, then slurred] She's mean...

Scorpia: [yelling, desperate] She's misunderstood! You of all people should know that! I mean, you grew up together... [softer, sadly] I can't compete with that. [hands Adora to Sea Hawk] No matter what I do, I can't seem to break down her walls. [steps away] But you two...[sits on a container] even when you're trying to kill each other, you can tell there's a real bond there. I just...[even more sadly, almost sobbing] I wish she would see me as being worth her time, too.

Sea Hawk: [tears dripping with plops] I--[shakes] I know how you feel. [sniffs]

[scene transition to inside the lab]

[the room rattles and rubble falls from the ceiling]

Catra: Always great to see you, Sparkles, but we're a little busy here!

Glimmer: Where's the disc, Catra?

Catra: What, you didn't like my new, improved version of She-Ra?

Bow: [arrow clangs as he sheathes it; imploring Entrapta, please. Look who you're working with. [Entrapta taps at a tablet on the floor with her hair, making it beep] Whatever the Horde is giving you, it's not worth the damage you're doing to Etheria. Those monsters outside are infected by the same virus that's infecting She-Ra! [he grunts as a loud thud crashes into the room]

Entrapta: Infected? That can't be right. The disc only infects First Ones tech, unless--[gasps loudly, excitedly] the bugs are First Ones tech! [rolls herself away]


[Inside the closet]

[Sea Hawk and Scorpia sit facing each other and Adora lies on the ground nearby, yawning]

Sea Hawk: I mean, just once I'd like to hang out with Mermista and her friends. I'm good at groups! I have excellent stories of derring-do! Why don't they want me around? [rests head on hand]

Scorpia: [sighs] Oh, I hear ya. Catra's been so busy since she got promoted, but she still always expects me to make time for her. Does she even understand how much I do for her?!

Sea Hawk: Exactly! It seems like...the only time anyone wants to hang is when they need me to give them a ride, or do something for them.

Scorpia: [groans] Ugh, tell me about it. Catra once used my rock hard exoskeleton as a nail file. [voice cracking] I even had to buff!

[Sea Hawk begins to laugh slowly, then more vigorously, and Scorpia laughs, too]

Scorpia: [sincerely] Is there...something wrong with us?

Adora: [slowly, slightly slurring] You know...you guys are really great. You're just, like, the best. You're good friends, and good people. [slaps her arm around Scorpia's shoulder; squeakily chuckling] And I like you... You are so pointy! [taps at Scorpia's shoulder spikes]

Sea Hawk: You know what? She's right. We are really great. [confidently] I'm clever, roguishly good-looking, and a top-notch sailor. [hops onto a container] I don't care if anyone else thinks I'm cool. I don't need their opinions to validate me. [shouts] I'm Sea Hawk!

Scorpia: [confidently] And me? I am brave, strong, [hugs Adora, still attached to her shoulder] give great hugs, and I'm loyal. [sits Adora down; to Adora] You may have left Catra, but someday, she's gonna see that I won't. [grows in volume] I'll always be there for her, because that's who I am!

Adora: [claps enthusiastically; happily] Yayyy!

Scorpia: [punches at the air] And I'm also someone who's about to go kick some bug butt!

Sea Hawk: [excitedly] Let's show them what we're made of!


[Inside the lab]

[The room rumbles, and the monsters roar]

Glimmer: [nervously] We have to destroy the disc, or none of us are getting out of here!

Catra: [feigning ignorance smugly] Huh. Guess I must've lost it.

Entrapta: [rolling around] Oh, Catra, it's in your pocket, remember?

[Catra groans; Glimmer and Bow ready their weapon/magic; Catra gasps as the room rumbles and cracks form on the wall; Catra shouts as the wall is burst through and she is thrown and crashes into containers; Glimmer and Bow scream; beams hit the monster as it roars and thrashes, leaving]

Scorpia: [running in with Sea Hawk and Adora; shouting] For the Horde!

Sea Hawk: [shouting] I don't agree with that sentiment, but I'm also here!

Adora: [mimicking laser noises and flourishing her mop] Pew, pew-pew!

[The monster thrashes and breaks more of the wall, roaring]

Adora: [Glimmer runs up] Heyy, I know you.

Glimmer: [hugging her] Adora! I'm so glad you're okay. [They embrace again as Sea Hawk screams when rubble falls from above]

Scorpia: [rushes to shield Catra from falling rubble; concerned] Catra, are you all right?

Catra: [frustrated] Just find the sword. I've got Adora!

[Catra runs and Glimmer slams into her, both grunting; they roll on the ground struggling; Adora meanders around giggling with the mop and Bow readies to shoot; Catra holds the disc up out of Glimmer's reach until Glimmer pushes her arm and it clatters to the ground; Catra pushes Glimmer off her and runs for the disc, while Bow fires his arrow, whistling toward the disc; Catra catches the arrow and flings it back, causing Bow to exclaim and jump out of the way of its explosion; Catra grabs the disc and runs just as Glimmer teleports behind her]

[Scorpia crawls, searching for the sword, spotting it just as Adora does, too; Adora's foot squeaks as she giggles and turns to look down at the sword]

Scorpia: Oh, no you don't!

Adora: [happily] Hiii....[Scorpia yells as she tackles Adora, crashing into containers]

Sea Hawk: [stepping out, brandishing his laser sword] En garde!

[The monster roars and breaks through the wall a bit more]

Glimmer: [frustratedly, straining to hold Catra down] Just. Give. Us. The. Disc!

Catra: Are you kidding? I've got control of Adora. I am not giving that up.

[The monster roars and finally worms its way through, crashing its jaws into where Catra and Glimmer were as they both scream and jump away; Glimmer grunts as she rolls and bumps into a container; Catra's shoes squeak as she slides away grunting; Catra gasps as the monster turns to her and roars; she grunts more as it crashes into containers chasing her]

[Scorpia, Bow, and Sea Hawk all strain, Sea Hawk laying underneath Scorpia reaching for the sword while Bow holds her back with his bow; Catra pants and grunts as the monster throws her into a container with a thud, the disc clattering on the ground; the monster roars louder]

Bow: Catra, you have to destroy the disc. It's the only way to stop them!

Scorpia: [shouting, concerned] Catra!

[Catra yells out as she dodges the monster, hopping up onto containers to evade as it crashes through them; she drops the disc and it clatters on the floor as she gets trapped holding the monster's jaws open, shouting as she strains against it; Scorpia picks up the disc]

Glimmer: Scorpia, you can end this. You've got to break the disc now!

Catra: [angrily, growling as she strains against the monster] Don't. You. Dare!

Scorpia: [looking back and forth between Catra and the disc, hesitatingly nervous] Uh....uh...

Sea Hawk: [moving between Bow and Glimmer; profoundly] It seems to me that caring about someone is the greatest adventure of them all.

Scorpia: [smiles at Sea Hawk, then determinedly] Sorry, Wildcat. This...is for your own good.

Catra: [screams angrily] NO!

[Scorpia breaks the disc, causing a wave of energy to surge into the monster, and it growls; Catra grunts as she jumps free; the monster whirs as it slithers away, meeting another and crashing out into the snow]

Adora: [groans tiredly] Oh...What happened?

[Catra groans as she gets up; Adora and Catra share a look and Adora grunts; Scorpia grabs Catra, and Catra grunts in surprise]

Catra: [angrily] Hey! Put me down! [she gasps slightly as she looks at the determined expression on Scorpia's face as she carries Catra and Entrapta out of the base]


[On the ocean, in a Horde ship speeding along]

Catra: [sneezes; her voice trembles in the cold, angrily] What are you so happy about? She-Ra won and we didn't get what we came for. The mission was a failure. [more softly, upset] How are we going to explain this one to Hordak?

Entrapta: Failure? This mission was a resounding success. [rolls out First Ones tech; trilling] Ta-daaa! I got the First Ones tech!

Catra: [incredulous] What? When did you even--How long have you had that?!

Entrapta: A while. But we were having so much fun, I didn't want to say anything. Isn't it amazing? This puppy'll be able to power Hordak's portal technology and then some! [laughs maniacally, rolling the tech away; walking through an opening door] Hordak is gonna be so thrilled! [door shuts after her]

[Scorpia shivers next to Catra]

Catra: [quietly] Hey. Thanks for getting us out of there.

Scorpia: Any time. [shivers, teeth chattering]

Catra: [groans] All right, come on. [gestures opening up the blanket for Scorpia to crawl in]

Scorpia: [hopeful, excited] Really?! Yes! [crawls over and wraps the blanket around herself] Thank you! [sharp intake of breath, leaning against Catra] ...Oh, gosh. Look at us. Just...two peas in a pod. [The ship speeds off into the distance, motor whirring as Scorpia's voice fades out] So when I brought it up before I said board games, but [chuckles] I mean, it doesn't have to be board games, we could do anything, I mean, I'm open. I-I like a-ah, bowling, ah, it's very difficult for me with my claws, but...[fades out]
