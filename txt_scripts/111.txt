Adora: [Yelling, echoing] Hello? [Draws sword] I carry the sword of She-Ra, and I've come here for help. Is anyone there?

Hologram: Greetings, [Adora shrieks in surprise] administrator. What is your query?

Adora: Oh. I need your help to heal my friend. She's been cursed, and I-I don't know how to save her. The legends say that She-Ra could heal people using this sword. How do I do that?

Hologram: What is your query?

Adora: Not this again. [Scoffs] ...For the honor of Grayskull!


She-Ra: How about now?

Hologram: Administrator detected. Welcome, She-Ra.


She-Ra: One more time. What can you tell me about this sword?

Hologram: Subject: The Sword of Protection. Classification: portable Runestone keyed exclusively to Administrator: She-Ra, Princess of Power.

She-Ra: How can I use the sword to heal my friend?

Hologram: Query not recognized.

She-Ra: [Groans, drags hand down face with a squeak] The legends say the sword has healing powers. Is that true?

Hologram: One of the Sword of Protection's many intended functions is to heal and restore balance.

She-Ra: [Annoyed, enunciating] But how do I do that?

Hologram: Query not recognized.

She-Ra: [Angrily, enunciating] How can I use the sword to heal people?! [Lets sword tip clang lightly on floor]

Hologram: One of the Sword of Protection's [She-Ra groans exasperatedly, almost laughingly] many intended functions is to heal and restore balance.


She-Ra: [Sharp intake of breath] Okay. Is there someone else I can talk to?

Hologram: Query not recognized.

She-Ra: Okay. Has visions from when she first found the sword] [new determination] Let me talk to Light Hope.

Hologram: [Almost questioningly] Light Hope.(?)

She-Ra: Light Hope. That's her name isn't it? The woman I saw when I touched the sword for the first time? Where is she?

Hologram: Yes, Light Hope is here. She has been waiting for you.

She-Ra: Can I talk to her?

Hologram: You will meet her soon enough. But first, you must let go.

She-Ra: What's that supposed to mean?

Hologram: You are not ready yet. You must let go.

She-Ra: Let go of what?



Catra: [Yelling] Hey! Watch it!

She-Ra: Catra? What are you doing here?

Hologram: [Thrums with different energy, turning red] Unauthorized presence detected. Security protocol activated.



She-Ra: No, no, no, not again!

Catra: What just happened?

She-Ra: This isn't good. You're not supposed to be in here.


Catra: [alarmed, enunciating] What are those?

She-Ra: Also not good!


She-Ra: Come on! We need to run!


Catra: What's going on? Why are those things trying to kill us?

She-Ra: They're trying to kill you. This place sees you as an invader.

Catra: Well, can't you tell them to stop?

She-Ra: [incredulously, frustrated] No, I can't tell them to stop! Clearly nothing in here is listening to me!


Catra: [expectantly, alarmed] --Adora?

She-Ra: Stand back!


Catra: [yelling] What are you doing?!


Adora: You shouldn't be here, Catra. Those things aren't going to stop until they get you, and as long as I'm protecting you, they'll see me as a threat, too.

Catra: [annoyed] Uh, good thing I didn't ask you to protect me.

Adora: [incredulous] Wait, you know, what-- Okay. Why are you here, anyway? I mean, how did you even find this place?

Catra: [annoyed, fatigued tone] It sent up a beam of light a mile high. It wasn't hard.

Adora: [lighter, genuinely curious tone] ...Does Shadow Weaver know you're here?

Catra: [imaginatively mirthful] I'd say Shadow Weaver's got bigger problems right now. [pauses, then distrustful] Why are you looking at me like that? Wait. Nooo... I know what this is about. [groans] Ugh, I knew you'd be weird about me letting you escape. I told you it's not because I like you.

Adora: I mean, I didn't--I didn't say anything.

Catra: Anyway, what are you doing here? [angrily] Where are your new best friends? I thought you guys did everything together.


Adora: [angrily, accusingly] Oh, my friends? You mean the ones you kidnapped and held for ransom? The ones you let Shadow Weaver imprison and curse?

Catra: [casual, disinterested tone] Yeah, obviously. What other friends would I be talking about?

Adora: ...Come on. Those things will be back any minute, we need to get out of here.

Catra: Well, we don't need to go together. You do your weird little magic quest thing, I'll find my own way out.


Catra: [Groans] Another dead end.

Adora: No, it's not. [places her hand on the wall] Eternia. [Catra looks at her in disbelief] Eh, long story.


Catra: Cool, you found the Infinite Darkness room. Have fun, I'm gonna find another way around. ...Uh...where'd the door go?

Adora: Wait, I think I see something. Hello? Light Hope?


Catra: What's

Adora: [angrily, shoving Catra with a forearm to the neck into the nearby column; accusingly] What kind of game are you playing?!

Catra: [shaking her head and raising her hands, disarmingly] Whoa, whoa! I have no idea what's going on. There's no way we can actually be in the Fright Zone!

Adora: [accusingly] So what is this, another Shadow Weaver mind trick?!

Catra: I doubt it. Now let--[with effort, pushing Adora's arm away]--go of me!


Catra: Hey, you! Guard. ...Uh, hello? [waves arm in front of their face, then attempts to poke their helmet when her finger phases through the simulation with a digital glitching noise; starts laughing and yells out] Hey, Adora! This isn't real! ...Adora? [a different tone of voice, almost scared as the scene changes to Adora standing elsewhere] Adora?!

Adora: [alarmed] Catra?


Young Catra: [calls out] Adora! [runs glitching through Present Adora's legs. Adora looks where she went and sees a younger version of herself looking at Young Catra's face]

Catra: [walking up behind] Hey, Adora? There's a--

Adora: [shushes] Shh.

Young Catra: [sniffles and grunts] Does it look broken to you?! [sniffs a few times]

Young Adora: [incredulous, almost laughingly] It's not broken, you're fine!

Young Catra: [looks at her hand where she touched her nose and shrieks] I'm bleeding!

Young Adora: You're not bleeding! And why would you try and pick a fight with Octavia anyway?

Young Catra: I didn't do anything, all I did was exist near her. ...And scratch her on the eyeball. And call her a dumbface.

Young Adora: [scoffs] Catra--

Young Catra: What?! She has a dumb face!

Young Adora: [lowers voice in a disarming, complying way; offers her hand] Where is she?


Young Adora: Hey, Octavia!


Young Adora: You're a dumbface!


Young Catra: [laughing] She's coming!

Young Adora: Run!

Catra: [exasperated] What was that?!

Adora: It must have been some kind of simulation. It's tapping into our memories. Why, I have no idea...

Catra: [groans] Ugh, this place is so weird. How can you deal with all of this magic stuff?

Adora: [annoyed] I'm only dealing with it because I need to figure out how to heal Glimmer after someone got her cursed.

Catra: [angrily] What do you want? An apology? [shoves Adora, causing her to grunt] You're not getting one.


Adora: [genuinely] ...Can I ask you something?

Catra: [sighs bordering on a groan] Can I stop you?


Adora: ...Why did you help me escape after Shadow Weaver captured us?

Catra: [fatigued, disinterested] Not this again.


Adora: It's the one thing I can't figure out. You didn't have to do that. You could've gotten caught...why risk it? [Rock on the edge crumbles beneath her; yelps] Whoa, whoa, whoa--!


Catra: Did you really think I'd just let Shadow Weaver erase your memory like that?

Adora: I dunno. Probably.


Catra: Yeah, well, you never did have too much faith in me.

Adora: [sighs; lightly] Can you blame me?

Catra: [half-chuckles] Not really.

Catra: It wasn't all bad growing up in the Fright Zone, was it? I mean, you still have some good memories, right?

Adora: Of course I do. But it doesn't change the fact that the Horde is evil. I had no choice. I couldn't go back. ...Hey. I miss you, too.

Catra: Wha--? [scoffs] I don't miss you. [kicks at Adora, causing her to yelp in surprise] Get over yourself!

Adora: Not until you admit you like me!


Catra: I don't like you!


Catra: [frustratedly] Oh, come on!



Young Catra: [feigning pain] Oww!

Young Adora: [concerned] You okay?

Training Handler: And there's our winner.

Training Handler: Good work, cadet. I like your focus. This win will definitely be reported back to Lord Hordak.

Young Catra: [walking up to Lonnie, upset] What was that? Way to gang up on me!

Young Lonnie: You were fighting dirty. I was just leveling the field.

Young Adora: Hey, you were awesome! [concerned] Did I hurt you?

Young Catra: [feigning impervious] No, I'm fine. You're just lucky I let you win.

Young Adora: [smugly, holding out the syllable] Right...

Young Catra: I'm serious! [scoffs] If I came in first, people might expect me to actually start doing stuff around here. Trust me, second place suits me just fine.

Young Adora: [still a little smug, but letting it go] Yeah, okay. Come on, let's go cool down.

Young Catra: In a minute, I'll meet you there.

Young Adora: [calling out] Hey, guys, wait up!

Disembodied Hologram voice: Unauthorized presence detected. Security protocol activated.

Adora: Catra? [yells with concern] Catra!

Catra: [muffled by spider bot goo] Adora!

Adora: [rushing the mirror and banging on it] Catra! [seeing Catra being pulled away, she grunts in despair]

[Catra, being pulled away down a hall in the Crystal Castle, struggles against goo, grunting in effort]

Catra: [muffled] Adora! [Looking back at the empty hallway, then wiggling and straining against the goo, she cries out in anguish]

[Catra sheds tears of frustration, then elongates her claws with a metalllic shing; she grunts as she busts out of the goo and rips it apart; the spider bot squeaks and spits more goo at Catra, which she dodges and begins to fight the spider, grunting; it roars as she breaks its eyes and rips out cables, electricity zapping out; she does this a few times and then jumps off the spider as it collapses, zapping with electricity]

[Catra chuckles with confidence, beginning to step toward the spider to finish it, but Adora jumps up and grunts while impaling the bot with the sword]

Adora: [panting] Are you okay?

Catra: [as Adora takes a piece of goo off her shoulder; angrily] I had it.

Adora: Sure you did, we need to make sure we stay together from now on.

Catra: Will you stop telling me what to do?!

[Catra swats Adora's arm off her shoulder]

Catra: [angrily] I'm sick of this stupid place. Let's just get out of here.


[Catra grunts as she jumps across a few gaps in the floor]

Adora: [in disbelief] What is your problem? I was just trying to save you.

Catra: For the last time, I don't need you to save me. I've been doing just fine on my own. No thanks to you.

Adora: [grabbing Catra's arm] Catra, wait. ...I'm sorry for leaving. I couldn't go back to the Fright Zone, not after I saw what the Horde was really doing. I never wanted to leave you. ...You could come with me! You-you-you could join the rebellion! I know you're not a bad person, Catra. You don't belong with the Horde.

[A wind blows as a door opens in the Fright Zone]

Catra: [crosses her arms; tiredly] Let's just get this over with.


[Young Catra, about 5-7, runs past Present Adora and Catra; she grunts as she leaps and swings across cables hanging from the ceiling, landing nearby, laughing a bit; Young Adora hangs from cables behind her]

Young Adora: Catra, wait up! [grunts and swings herself]

Young Catra: What's it like being the world's slowest person?

[Young Adora grunts, missing and crashing into a trash heap]

[Both young versions run and laugh, Adora chasing after Catra; suddenly Young Catra stops and stares, Young Adora pulls at her hair, then stops, noticing]

Young Adora: [in awe] Whoa.

[They stare at the Black Garnet chamber]

Young Catra: [gasps] It's open.

Young Adora: We're definitely not allowed in there. [slight chuckle]

[Young Adora looks at Young Catra with a smile, then runs toward the room laughing; Catra follows, half chuckling; Present Adora and Present Catra stand watching]

Adora: You don't have to go in there.

[Catra walks in, Adora follows]

[The young versions are in awe of the chamber, gasping; Young Catra gets closer to the Black Garnet]

Young Catra: [in awe] Wow...

[She touches it, and it delivers a shock as she shrieks in pain]

Young Adora: [nervously] Ma-maybe we should get out of here.

[They hear Shadow Weaver groaning from the hallway and run to hide; Shadow Weaver comes in and touches the Garnet, electricity zapping around her hand; she seems to sigh in relief, going over to her scrying table, where she takes off her mask with a click as it unhinges]

[Young Adora gasps in shock at the sight; Shadow Weaver whips turns around and also gasps in shock at the two children; Young Catra gasps as they start to run away]

Shadow Weaver: [screams angrily] Get out!

[Young Adora cries out in alarm as dark magic encloses the exit]

Shadow Weaver: Catra... [Young Adora turns to see Young Catra's form enveloped in a paralyzing, zapping magic] ...you stay.

[Young Catra grunts as she is forced to stand]

Shadow Weaver: What do you think you're doing in here?

[Shadow Weaver makes Young Catra turn, feet squeaking on the floor as she does so without picking up her feet; Shadow Weaver clicks her mask back in place]

Catra: [fearfully] We were just playing.

Shadow Weaver: [hatefully] Insolent child. I've come to expect such disgraceful behavior from you. But I will not allow you to drag Adora down as well.

Adora: [pleading] Shadow Weaver, it wasn't her fault, it was my idea, too!

Shadow Weaver: [hatefully, still talking to Catra] You have never been anything more than a nuisance to me! I've kept you around this long because Adora was fond of you, but if you ever do anything to jeopardize her future, I will dispose of you myself. [slowly, enunciating] Do you understand?

Young Adora: [runs between them, throwing her arms out to protect Young Catra; pleading] Please stop!

[The dark magic dissipates back into Shadow Weaver's cloak as she groans and moves back toward the Garnet; Young Adora and Young Catra share a look before Young Adora runs over to Shadow Weaver]

Young Adora: She didn't mean to!

Shadow Weaver: [placidly, attempting to soothe] Adora, you must do a better job of keeping her under control. [Shadow Weaver finally lets Young Catra out of the paralyzing magic and Young Catra grunts as she falls to the ground] Do not let something like this happen again. [she pats Young Adora's head as Young Catra looks on]


[Young Adora and Catra are walking down a hall in the Fright Zone, just after this incident; they walk past a pillar and become Present Adora and Catra again]

Catra: [grunts, swatting Adora's arm off her shoulder; angrily] You always need to play the hero, don't you?

Adora: [angrily] I was only trying to protect you.

Catra: [yells, angrily] You never protected me! Not in any way that would put you on Shadow Weaver's bad side.

[Scene transitions to Young Adora and Catra in the same place]

Young Catra: [angrily, accusingly] Admit it. You love being her favorite!

Young Adora: [upset] That's not true!

Young Catra: Oh, yeah? [glitches back to Present Catra (and Adora)] When you left, who do you think took the fall for you? [prods at Adora's chest] Who was protecting me then?

Adora: You don't have to let Shadow Weaver treat you like that anymore. You can leave--[glitches back to Young Adora and Catra]--just like I did!

Young Catra: Oh, because I need to follow you everywhere you go?!

Young Adora: [frustratedly] I didn't mean it that way.

[glitches back to Present Adora and Catra]

Catra: [angrily, haltingly] I don't. Want. To leave. What don't you understand about that? I'm not afraid of Shadow Weaver anymore, and I'm a better Force Captain than you would've ever been.

[glitches back to Young Adora and Catra]

Young Adora: [quietly, in disbelief] You always said you didn't care about things like that...

Young Catra: [cries out, tears falling] Well, I was lying, obviously!

[glitches back to Present Adora and Catra; Catra begins to walk away]

Adora: [runs after and grabs onto Catra's shoulder] Catra, just wait!

Catra: [removes and holds Adora's arm above their heads] Why do you think I gave the sword back to you in the Fright Zone? I didn't want you to come back, Adora!

[Catra releases Adora's arm, walking away as Adora stands in shocked disbelief; the room glitches and spider bots screech behind Adora as she gasps]

Adora: [draws the sword; shouting] For the honor of--[grunts as spider bot goo shoots the sword out of her grasp and knocks her to the ground] Huh?


[The Fright Zone simulation is glitching as Catra grunts, running past a bunch of glitching memories]

Young Lonnie: You were fighting dirty.

Shadow Weaver: Insolent child.

Adora: I'm sorry, Catra--

Catra: [shouts haltingly as she swipes at holograms] Let. Me. OUT OF HERE!

[Catra groans as she falls to the ground on all fours; she hears a crying noise, stands and turns, finding a younger Catra, maybe 5 or younger, crying and hiding her face in a blanket on their bunk in the Fright Zone]

Young Adora: [peers from around a doorway] ...Catra?

[Young Catra continues to sob as Young Adora walks to her; Young Adora peels back the cover from Young Catra's face, and Young Catra hisses]

Young Adora: [reassuringly] Catra, it's okay, it's just me. [sits next to her as Young Catra wipes away tears] It doesn't matter what they do to us, you know? You look out for me, and I look out for you. Nothing really bad can happen as long as we have each other.

Young Catra: You promise?

Catra: You promise?

Young Adora: I promise.

[Young Catra clings onto Young Adora for a few moments]

Young Adora: [slightly chuckling]...Come on, let's go back out.

[They stand and walk away; Young Catra stops before following Young Adora the rest of the way, and stares up at Present Catra for a long moment, then follows; Catra gets a determined look on her face as the room around her glitches back to darkness]


[Some other part of the Crystal Castle]

[Adora grunts as she fights the spider bots, destroying an eye and ripping a piece off and tossing it away; she runs to strain to remove her sword from where it's stuck by the goo overlooking a chasm]

[Adora shouts as spider goo traps her from behind and a spider lifts her over the chasm]

Adora: Stop it, I'm not your enemy. Light Hope... Just let me talk to Light Hope!

[she grunts as she shoves off the spider's leg with her feet, causing her to fall; she shouts, but swings the goo around her arms to latch onto a rock along the chasm wall; the spider sparks and screeches before metal crashing nearby is heard; Catra grunts as she destroys all the spiders]

Adora: [hopeful] Catra?

Catra: [holding the sword, rubs a finger along its side] Hey, Adora.

Adora: [pleading] Catra, help me, please...

Catra: [contemplatively unhurried] This thing wouldn't work for me if I tried, would it? It only works for you. Then again, you're special. That's what Shadow Weaver always said.

Adora: [angrily] Catra...what are you doing?

Catra: Ah, you know? It all makes sense now. You've always been the one holding me back. You wanted me to think I needed you. You wanted me to feel weak. Every hero needs a sidekick, right?

Adora: [desperately] Catra, no, that's not how it was...

Catra: [laughs humorlessly] The sad thing is, I've spent all this time hoping you'd come back to the Horde, when really you leaving was the best thing that ever happened to me. [lowers sword near the goo holding Adora up] I am so much stronger than anyone [cuts a few strands of the goo] ever thought.

[Adora grunts, losing one hand holding onto the goo]

Catra: [contemplatively] I wonder what I could've been if I'd gotten rid of you sooner...

[Catra cuts the last of the goo holding Adora up; Adora shrieks as she falls, catching a rock handhold on the way down]

Adora: [breathing heavily; desperately] I-I'm sorry! I never meant to make you feel like you were second best! Please don't do this!

[The light in the room glitches away making room for darkness; Catra looks at the sword, then tosses it into the chasm; it clangs on the way down, Adora gasps lightly]

Catra: Bye, Adora. I really am going to miss you.

[the room continues to disappear]

Adora: [shouts desperately] Catra! Catra, no! [pants and breaths heavily, beginning to tear up]

Light Hope: Adora.

[Adora gasps and still breaths heavily]

Light Hope: [haltingly] You must. Let. Go.

[Adora sobs lightly as tears fall; she lets her hand slip from the rock]


[Fright Zone, Entrapta's lab]

[Entrapta works on Emily, her tools zapping]

Scorpia: [sighs happily] And then there's the day, Catra and I were on a boat together! Did I ever tell you about that?

Entrapta: [flipping up her mask] I'm pretty sure you did. [pulls out recorder and rewinds]

Voice of Scorpia from the recorder: Oh, and one time, Catra and I, were on a boat together! That was the best day ever.

Entrapta: Yep, you did. [flips mask back down and continues working on Emily]

Scorpia: [Emily beeps as Entrapta works on her] I think that's really when we made our connection, you know? [the door to the lab slides open, revealing a disheveled Catra] You ever meet someone and you just instantly click?

Entrapta: [muffled, tinny resonating due to mask] Yes, it was like that with Emily.

Scorpia: [gets up in Catra's face as Catra walks to a different place in the room; concerned, incredulously] What happened to you? You're filthy! Are you okay? Do you need first aid? Do you need to be nursed tenderly back to health?!

Catra: [through her teeth] Scorpia, remember that talk we had about personal space?

Scorpia: Oh, right. Ten-foot radius.

[Catra turns to find Entrapta in her face]

Entrapta: How'd it go? Did you find it?

Catra: Uh, why is the princess loose?

Entrapta: Ohhh, right. [runs and hops, grunting, back into her restraints that click] Seriously, though, did you find it?

[Catra smiles and tosses the crystal to Entrapta who catches it]

Entrapta: [happy disbelief] An intact data crystal? [releases herself from restraints] I have never seen one so perfectly preserved. This could be a game-changer. Who knows what secrets it could contain? [laughs maniacally and goes to dance with Scorpia]

Scorpia: [happily] Oh, man, I knew Catra could do it. [Catra goes to leave] It's like I was telling you, [enunciating] she is the best friend ever.

Catra: ...Just keep it down. I'm going to bed.
