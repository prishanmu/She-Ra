Bow: Hey, we made it.

Adora: Whoa.

Glimmer: Welcome to Bright Moon.


Adora: It’s so beautiful.

Glimmer: Okay, I just need to go in there, recharge, and deal with my mom. [groans] This’ll be fun.

Glimmer: Uh, Bow? Maybe we should take Adora in the back way?

Bow: Oh, yeah. Good call.

Adora: What’s the back way?


Adora: This is the back way?

Bow: It might seem weird, but we totally come in this way all the time.

Bow: Oh! Hey, here. Why don’t you put this robe on? No reason.

Adora: You’re trying to hide me.

Bow: [voice cracking] What? No!

Angella: Glimmer! Where have you been?

Glimmer: Hey, mom.

Angella: All of Bright Moon has been worried sick. What were you thinking?

Glimmer: Mom!

Angella: [voice echoes and becomes distorted] How could you be so selfish and disobedient?

Glimmer: [groans and faints]

Angella: [gasps] Glimmer.


Glimmer: [groaning]

Angella: Are you all right?

Glimmer: I’m fine, mom.

Angella: Don’t think you’re not still in trouble. You didn’t even take the time to charge up before you left?

Glimmer: I didn’t think I’d be gone that long.

Angella: Where did you go, anyway?

Glimmer: Okay. Bow and I found a piece of super powerful First Ones tech in the woods. We knew it would really help the Rebellion, so we went to get it and bring it back. But we got a little sidetracked. It was fine, though, and I totally had it under control. And while we were out there, we found something even better!

Angella: What did you find?

Glimmer: I can’t tell you yet. But you’re gonna love it. I promise!

Angella: Glimmer—

Glimmer: Ah! Just wait here. I’ll be right back.

Angella: We are not done talking about this, Glimmer. Glimmer!



Adora: Okay, I get it. I’m guessing the people of Bright Moon are gonna be a little less welcoming of a Horde soldier than you led me to believe.

Bow: Maybe a little.

Adora: How little?

Bow: Think pitchforks and torches.



Bow: It’s just that the people of Bright Moon have been really hurt by the Horde. Everyone here has lost someone in the war. You can’t blame them for being a little suspicious.

Adora: Sorry.

Bow: Hey, it’s not your fault. Once they get to know you, the people of Bright Moon are going to trust you just like Glimmer and I already—



Glimmer: [Appears] I’m here! Okay, my mom’s on her way, but no one panic.

Adora: What?

Glimmer: [shouting] I said no one panic!

Glimmer: Don’t worry, she’ll love you. All you have to do is use the sword to transform into She-Ra before she gets here.

Bow: Wait, we’re jumping straight to She-Ra with your mom? Are you sure?

Glimmer: Yeah, I don’t think my mom is going to buy, “Hey mom, we found a Horde soldier. Can we keep her?”

Glimmer: My mom is gonna love She-Ra. We can ease her into the Horde stuff later.

Adora: Uh, Glimmer, look. I don’t know if I can just ‘turn on’ She-Ra. I’ve only done it when someone was in danger before, and it felt a little out-of-control last time. I’m still figuring out how all of this stuff works.

Glimmer: How hard can it be? Sword, magic words, poof! She-Ra!

Glimmer: Hey. You’re gonna do great, okay? Bow and I will go buy you some time. Just hang out here with the sword and think She-Ra thoughts. I believe in you!

Bow: [grunts as Glimmer grabs him and teleports away]

Adora: [sighs] Right. Okay, sword, it’s just you and me now. So, uh…let’s do this. [chuckles]

Adora: For the honor of Gray—


Adora: Horsey! [hugs horse]

Adora: Oh! This is much better. There’s actually room to move around here.

Adora: Ready to see something cool?

Adora: [takes a deep breath] For the honor of Grayskull!

Adora: Okay, let’s try that again. For the honor of Grayskull!


Adora: [in a deep voice] For the honor of Grayskull!

Adora: [in normal voice] For the honor of Grayskull!

Adora: [whispers to sword] For the honor of Grayskull.

Adora: [grunting and swinging the sword wildly] For…the…honor…of…Grayskull.

Adora: [frustrated grunt] For the honor of Grayskull.

Adora: [lying on her back in defeat] Honor of Grayskull, blah blah blah.


Adora: Oh, come on! Glimmer’s counting on me. Don’t leave me hanging here.

Adora: For the honor of Grayskull!


Adora: Horsey, no!


Adora: Horsey, it’s okay!


Crowd: [shouting]

Adora: No! No, wait! Horsey! Stop!

Adora: [runs after Swift Wind] Horsey!


Adora: Come back!

Woman: [muttering] Horde soldier…

Bright Moon Soldier: Horde Soldier!

Adora: Wait, you don’t understand. Stop! I’m not with the Horde. Just listen to me!


Woman 1: [As Adora escapes] Go! Get her!

Woman 2: Don’t let her get away!

Woman 1: Move!

Angella: For the last time, what is this grand surprise that I’m supposed to be so impressed with?

Glimmer: You’ll see it in just a minute, Mom. I promise.

Glimmer: Bow, can you go check and make sure that the surprise is ready for us?

Bow: You got in, Princess.

Angella: [As Bow leaves] I like that boy.

Gimmer: I know you do, Mom. And you’re gonna like this surprise even more. [chuckles]

Bow: [returns and drags Glimmer over to the side] So…problem.

Glimmer: What?

Woman: Your majesty. A horde spy has been discovered on the Bright Moon grounds. She attacked our troops with a sword and then fled with the help of a winged beast.

Angella: What did you do?!

Lonnie: I’m telling you. This new princess is no joke. She wiped the floor with our whole recon squad. Twelve feet tall at least! Took out every one of our machines with nothing but a sword.

Woman: Did you actually see her?

Lonnie: No. And it’s a good thing, too. We were lucky to get out of there alive.

Catra: Oh, please. She’s like every other princess: all sparkle, no substance. She caught us off-guard. That is all.

Lonnie: Sure. You were the only one who saw her up close, and you didn’t even land a hit on her.

Lonnie: What? Did you freeze up?

Catra: [growls] You think I’m scared of some princess? I could take her out whenever I want. I know her secret.

Lonnie: [scroffs] Oh yeah?

Catra: [grunts as Lonnie pushes her away]

Lonnie: And what’s that?

Catra: [growling] Hmm. Like I’d tell you.

Lonnie: Easy, Catra. Adora’s not here to protect you anymore.

· Scene changes to the Whispering Woods.

Adora: [panting] Stupid. You just had to go out there, even after Bow warned you about the pitchforks and torches.

Adora: [scoffs] What do you want from me now? Haven’t I done enough for you?

Adora: [annoyed] For the honor of Grayskull?


Adora: [sighs] What’s wrong with you?
Razz
Razz


Adora: Horsey? Is that you?

Razz: [humming as she sweeps around her hut]

Razz: Hm? Did you hear something? Yes, I did, too. Who’s there?!

Adora: [emerges] I, uh, didn’t mean to intrude. Um, but have you seen a flying horse around here?

Razz: Oh, Mara, dearie! Is that you? About time you got here. Come on now, there’s no time to waste. Let’s get going.

Adora: [entering the hut] Uh, you were waiting for me?

Razz: [laughs[ We made plans to go berry-picking today.

Adora: Look, I’m sorry, but I think you’ve mistaken me for someone else. I don’t know who you are.

Razz: No, you don’t know Madame Razz, do you? You’re not quite the same. This is the wrong time for my Mara, isn’t it? Now you’ve got the sword, instead.

Adora: Wait, what?

Razz: Ah! Well, never mind. You’re here now, and there’s still berries to be picked.


Adora: Hey, uh, you’ve said something about the sword. Have you seen it before?

Razz: [chuckles] Don’t ask such silly questions, Mara. You know you bring that sword around here all the time.

Adora: I’m not—Okay. How long have you been living out here in the woods alone?

Razz: Alone? Me? Oh, no! I’m not alone. I’ve got Broom here, and my friend Loo-Kee, too! But he’s always hiding. [chuckles]

Adora: [chuckles nervously] Oh, good, she’s got imaginary friends.


Adora: Whoa.

Razz: Ah! Here we are.

Adora: I think I’ve seen a place like this before. This is a First Ones ruin, isn’t it?

Razz: [climbing the structure] And the best place to pick fresh berries!

Adora: Hey, be careful up there! That thing’s not safe.


Razz: [chuckles] Oh, dearie me! That was quite a tumble, eh?


Adora: Stars?

Razz: Oh, we used to come here to look at the stars. Do you remember, Mara? They’re all gone now. What happened to the stars?

Adora: I’ve seen them before. I know all of this somehow.


Adora: What is this? What’s happening to me?

Razz: [remains silent and eats another berry]

Adora: Look, I know you brought me here for a reason. If you know something about the sword, about me, you need to tell me!

Razz: I brought you here to pick berries, and your basket’s still empty. So, come on, silly.

Adora: Whoa! [Razz grabs her by the arm and drags her off]


Catra: [grunts and slashes the drawing, sobbing quietly, then looks-down at her pillow before she begins shouting and crying hysterically, tearing the pillow to shreds.]

Shadow Weaver: [entering] Catra!

Catra: [scrambling out of the bed] What do you want?

Shadow Weaver: Impertinent as always, I see. With such a grand failure under your belt, it would benefit you to show more respect, cadet.

Catra: I did exactly what you told me to do. You are the one who didn’t warn us there would be princesses there.

Shadow Weaver: I have you a simple task: bring back Adora. Instead, your squadron is ravaged, your war machines destroyed, and Adora is still missing.

Catra: News flash, old lady: if Adora wanted to come home, she'd be here right now. Adora's gone. She defected. And I’m starting to think she had the right idea. So maybe it’s you who should be showing a little more respect to me.

Shadow Weaver: Lies!


Shadow Weaver: I am out of patience to address your incompetence and your insubordination, cadet. You will answer to a higher power, Lord Hordak himself.


Adora: [grumbles] Wait! Will you slow down?

Razz: Eh? What’s that, dearie? I don’t have my glasses; you’ll have to speak up.

Adora: Oh, I know you can hear me. I just—I need you to tell me what to do!

Razz: [laughing] How would Madame Razz know what you should do?

Adora: Look, I left my whole life behind, looking for answers about where I came from and who I’m supposed to be. The Rebellion hates me, and I can’t go back to the Horde. And I wanna do the right thing, but I don’t know what that is.

Adora: [gasps]

Razz: Ah, it’s the same old story, dearie. Wicked people destroy what they cannot control.

Adora: They can’t just do this!

Razz: Once, the princesses would have protected us. But these days, they—they stay in their castles, protecting only their own lands. Meanwhile, the Horde creeps ever closer.

Razz: You’re very like my Mara, you know? Brave, loyal, but afraid.

Adora: I’m not afraid.

Razz: Dearie…[chuckles] You ran into the woods and asked the first old lady you could find what you should do!

Razz: No one is going to make this easy for you, dearie. Stop waiting for someone to tell you what the right thing to do is.

Razz: You’re a smart girl. What do you think?

Adora: I think…this is wrong.

Adora: Horsey.

Razz: Huh?

Adroa: [quietly] For the honor of Grayskull.

Horde Soldier: Keep those lines taut.

Adora: [grunts]


Swift Wind: [neighs and flies away]

She-Ra: Turn off your machines and leave this place now!

Horde Soldier: It’s the princess. Get her!

[grunting and shouting as She-Ra fights the horde soldiers]

Horde Soldier: Huh? Uh…

[more grunting and shouting as another wave of horde soldiers attack She-Ra]

Razz: That’s my girl. [laughs and tosses She-Ra her sword.]

Razz: [hitting a horde soldier with her broom] Take that, you great lump! Razzle Dazzle!

She-Ra: Razz, no! You can’t be here!

Swift Wind: [neighs and attacks the horde soldier before flying away]

Razz: Woo-hoo!


Razz: Mara, dear!

Horde Soldier: Yeah!

[Horde soldiers shouting as they close in on Razz and She-Ra]

Razz: Razzle Dazzle! [throws down her berries and creates a smokescreen]

Swift Wind: [whinnies]

Razz: Hello, dearie.

Adora: Ow.

Razz: Swift Wind and I have been talking while you were asleep. He thanks you for coming to his rescue.

Adora: Swift Wind?

Razz: That’s what he prefers to be called. Also, he wanted me to make sure that you know that “Horsey” was a stupid name.

Razz: How do you feel?

Adora: I’m…I’m okay. I think I know what I need to do.

Adora: If the princesses won’t defend Etheria, then I will.

Adora: I need to get back to Bright Moon.

Razz: Ah, that’s the spirit, dearie!

Adora: Will I see you again?

Razz: If you need me, you will always know where to find me.

Razz: [retreating to her hut] Who was that girl?

Adora: [to Swift Wind] Um…any chance I can get a ride back to Bright Moon, Swift Wind? Please?

Swift Wind: [whinnies]

Adora: [laughing]

Swift Wind: [neighing]

Adora: Woo-hoo! [laughs]

Angella: How could you possibly think this was acceptable?!

Glimmer: Mom, you don’t understand! You’re not listening!

Angella: You’ve shown remarkably poor judgment! Allowing a Horde soldier into Bright Moon without telling me?

Bow: Your majesty, it’s not all her fault.

Angella: Bow, I think it’s time you went home. Glimmer and I have a lot to discuss.

Glimmer: Mom!

Angella: It can’t be.

Glimmer: I was trying to tell you. Mom, meet—

Angella: She-Ra.

She-Ra: Your Majesty, I’ve come to pledge myself to the Rebellion. But first, there’s something you should know.

Woman: She’s a Horde Soldier.

Glimmer: Mom, this is Adora.

Adora: [kneels and offers Angella the sword] I know you have no reason to trust me, Your Majesty. But I’ve seen for myself the atrocities the Horde has committed against the people of Etheria, and I’m ready to fight to stop them. If you give me the chance, I know I can help the Rebellion turn the tide of the war.

Angella: [takes the sword] I know the legend of the warrior the First Ones called She-Ra. They said she would return to us in the hour of our greatest need to bring balance to Etheria. I never thought she was anything more than a myth.

Angella: And yet you’re here now. And in the uniform of a Horde soldier, no less.

Angella: You would pledge to stand with us against those you once served?

Adora: [sighs] Yes.

Angella: Glimmer, you would vouch for her and take responsibility for her?

Glimmer: Yes.

Angella: Then rise. The Rebellion accepts your allegiance, She-Ra, Princess of Power.

Crowd: [all chanting] She-Ra! She-Ra! She-Ra!

Glimmer: [shouts and hugs Adora] Welcome to Bright Moon!

Bow: [hugs] But for real this time.

Shadow Weaver: Lord Hordak. [throws Catra onto the ground] Kneel!

Shadow Weaver: I gave her charge of a simple mission: to return Force Captain Adora to the Fright Zone. Instead, our forces suffered a humiliating defeat.

Hordak: Then you mean to tell me that you’re still down a Force Captain?

Shadow Weaver: Yes, my lord. But rest assured, nothing will stop us from finding Adora and bringing her back.

Hordak: No. You will elect another Force Captain and resume normal operations.

Shadow Weaver: But, my lord, Adora is the only viable candidate.

Hordak: You have Catra. Was she not your ward, as well?

Shadow Weaver: Catra has been nothing but a disappointment to me.

Hordak: If you have failed to condition her properly, you have no one but yourself to blame.

Shadow Weaver: But, my lord—

Hordak: Enough. I have made my decision. Rise, Force Captain Catra.

Hordak: Hmm.
