Angella: Council, we're looking for plans to strengthen our defenses against the Horde. Who would like to go first?

[Glimmer's hand shoots up.]

Glimmer: Me, me, me. Me. Me, me.

[Angella sighs.]

Angella: Who besides Glimmer would like to go first?

[Glimmer stands.]

Glimmer: Mom-- Uh, eugh, your majesty. You should let me, Bow, and Adora continue our princess recruitment mission. If we can form a new Princess Alliance, The Rebellion would actually stand a chance for once.

Angella: The princesses withdrew from the last alliance. They chose to focus on protecting their own lands.

Glimmer: So, are we supposed to just... give up? Please, let me try. All I'm proposing is a diplomatic mission.

Angella: [resigned] So, what do you propose?

[Glimmer activates a holographic map of Etheria.]

Glimmer: Anyone approaching Bright Moon by sea needs to pass through the Salineas Sea Gate. It's controlled by Mermista now that her father's retired. With her on our side, the Rebellion could control the seas. We NEED this alliance with her, Mom.

[Arrows appear on the map as Glimmer talks to illustrate her point. After she finishes talking, the map vanishes.]

Angella: The journey is treacherous, Glimmer. I'm not sure.

Glimmer: Don't worry, Mom. With She-Ra, we can conquer anything.

Adora: And, uh, we're also gonna need a boat.

Glimmer: With She-Ra and a boat, we can conquer anything.

Bow: Aaaaand an experienced sea captain.

[Glimmer makes an annoyed yell.]

Glimmer: With She-Ra, a boat, and an experienced sea captain, [through gritted teeth] we can conquer anything.

Angella: [resigned] Very well.

[Glimmer gasps.]

Glimmer: Yes!

[Glimmer teleports to kiss Angella and hug her.]

Angella: I mean it, Glimmer. No violence, and no collateral damage.

[Glimmer teleports between Bow and Adora, throwing her hands over them.]

Glimmer: [rapidly] Thanks, Mom, you won't regret it.

[Angella sighs. Intro plays. We see many flying boats outside a building on a cliff. Cut to Bow, Adora, and Glimmer entering. Various Etherians are cheering, drinking, making deals, playing cards. Cut to Bow, Adora, and Glimmer at the entrance. Bow looks excited.]

Bow: This is so cool. Seaworthy is just like I imagined it. Everyone here looks like a real pirate!

Glimmer: Focus, Bow. We're just here to find a sea captain.

Bow: No pirates?

Glimmer: No pirates.

Bow: [sadly] Arrrr.

Adora: None of these people look qualified to sail a ship.

[Glimmer goes up to the bar.]

Glimmer: Excuse me.

[Glimmer chuckles. She oohs as the camera pans to a muscular lady with short hair and an anchor tattoo.]

Glimmer: Er, we're looking for a sea captain to take us to Salineas.

[The lady points to two Etherians arm wrestling, surrounded by spectators. Sea Hawk wins the match.]

Sea Hawk: I won. Drinks all around. Put it on my friend here's tab.

[The trio approach him nervously.]

Glimmer: Uh, [chuckles] hiiii. We were told you're a sea captain?

Sea Hawk: I am the one and only Sea Hawk.

[Sea Hawk jumps up onto the table.]

Sea Hawk: Has my reputation preceded me?

Bow: [in awe] Your name is Sea Hawk? That's the coolest name I've ever heard!

[Glimmer and Sea Hawk sit at the table.]

Glimmer: Captain Sea Hawk, we're interviewing potential captains to take us to Salineas. Would you like to apply for the position?

Sea Hawk: [laughing] Apply for the position? I am the one and only Sea Hawk. I'm offer only.

[Adora puts her hands on the table.]

Adora: [exasperated] Okay. Just because "Sea" is in your name, doesn't tell us anything about your ACTUAL qualifications.

[Sea Hawk stands, putting his hands on the table and matching Adora's pose.]

Sea Hawk: Qualifications? I once ran the 50-klick Galebreath Gauntlet in less than 20 klicks. I maneuvered the straits of Serpentine with nary a chip in the paint of my bow. My shanties are considered so desirable, that sirens fling THEMSELVES into the sea at the sound of them. And because I can tell you're wondering, my mustache is... naturally shiny.

[Bow leans in to look at Sea Hawk's mustache.]

Bow: It IS shiny. You're hired.

[Glimmer elbows Bow aside and pushes in front of him.]

Bow: Ow.

Sea Hawk: Whoa, there, kids. What makes you think you can afford me?

Glimmer: I assure you, Captain Sea Hawk, money is no object.

[Sea Hawk hands Glimmer a folded piece of paper.]

Sea Hawk: Behold my fee.

[Glimmer opens the paper, gasps, and closes it again.]

Glimmer: Money might be an object. You know what, fine. We'll just find ANOTHER sea captain.

Sea Hawk: Good luck with that. You won't find another soul who knows the treacherous route to Salineas as well as I do. I brave it often to visit my close personal friend, Princess Mermista.

Glimmer: [gasps] You know her?

Sea Hawk: Uh do I?

[Adora laughs, slamming her hand down on the table. She sits down and holds her other arm up.]

Adora: Okay, well, here's the deal. We go one round, winner takes all. You win, we leave you alone. I win, you take us to Salineas. At no cost.

Sea Hawk: That's a terrible deal. But I am undefeated at arm wrestling. Let me show you how it's done, lassie.

[They grunt furiously as they arm wrestle.]

Bow: Go Adoraaaa, put him in the dirt.

Glimmer: This is so dumb.

Sea Hawk: Ha! Is this the best you've got? I once beat a Tyrosaur with biceps the size of my head in an arm-wrestling match that lasted two weeks.

[Adora shoves his hand onto the table.]

Adora: Ha!

Bow: Yeah! [laughs, high fives Adora]

Sea Hawk: [frowning] Well, truth be told, I let you win so as to, ahem, boost your confidence.

Mermista: Also your friend can turn into an 8 foot tall
