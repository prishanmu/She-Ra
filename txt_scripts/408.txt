Hordak: [laughs; commanding, to the bots behind him] Advance.

[Multiple bots' legs clang as they advance to the village; villagers run, panting and shouting in fear; a Horde tank rolls up and looms over a couple]

Sea Hawk: [triumphantly] Fear not, tiny friends... [his laser sword scrapes at he pulls it out of a bot] For Sea Hawk is here!

[The tank fires a blast at him, and Sea Hawk shouts and doges; the explosion flings him to slide on the ground between the two villagers, mustache crackling on fire]

Sea Hawk: Well, perhaps we should fear a little. [puffs out the fire on his mustache; stands and points] Let's go! [he pants, running, and the villagers pant fearfully after him]

[The tank fires a blast, exploding just ahead of them; Sea Hawk and the villagers gasp as another tank looms ahead in their new direction; the tank charges a blast; a pink explosion hits the tank]

Glimmer: [teleporting in behind the villagers; shouting] Hang on! [teleports the villagers away]

Sea Hawk: [softly] Huh?

[Two more tanks fly closer; Sea Hawk shouts an "Ohhh" in fear]

[Scene transition to nearby on a Rebellion ship]

[Spinnerella and Netossa bandage and help injured villagers who groan and grunt around on the ship]

Glimmer: [teleports] Netossa, this is the last of them, sound the--wait. Where's Sea Hawk? [seeing Netossa shrug, she groans and teleports, immediately coming back with Sea Hawk in her arms]

Sea Hawk: [hesitantly, hopefully] ...Adventure?

[Glimmer drops him and he grunts]

Glimmer: Okay. Now sound the retreat.

[Glimmer turns and looks at the village in the distance, a Horde flag flapping in the wind and explosions booming; Glimmer sighs, then notices a villager crying, who clings to Netossa, then another sobbing; Glimmer gasps, then narrows her eyes at Hordak looking at them in the distance; Hordak hums happily, smiling]

Glimmer: [angrily, determined] I'll be back for you.

[Opening theme]


[Bright Moon Castle, war room]

Bow: [reassuringly] I know it's been tough going since losing Salineas, but we're picking up the pieces. I'm sure we can turn this around. I mean, we captured Double Trouble. They're...refusing to talk to us, but still. So, uh... Swift Wind! [Swift Wind hums surprised] You just got back from scouting the Southern Coast. What does it look like?

Swift Wind: [happily] On fire.

Bow: Anything more specific?

Swift Wind: [confidently] On lots of fire.

Bow: [still attempting to be reassuring] Okayyy... Adora! You came from Plumeria; what's their status? Any good news?

Adora: [unhappily] Perfuma is securing the Whispering Woods and Frosta reports that her kingdom has not been breached....

Bow: [squeaks happier] Great.

Adora: ...yet. [enunciating, angrily] But the Horde's working on it. Day and night. Nonstop.

Bow: [still trying to be reassuring, almost nervously] Well...that is...ooo-kayyy. Because Sea Hawk, Netossa, and Spinnerella just saved everyone in Sea Elf Village...with Glimmer. Who didn't tell us she was going, but just...kind of showed up. [chuckles slightly]

Adora: [frustrated] Again? Glimmer, you can't just keep going off on your own.

Glimmer: [hums in feigned wonder] Hmm, where have I heard that before? [growing more annoyed] Oh, right. When I stayed here to find the Horde spy and Salineas fell.

Adora: [angrily] That's not fair. We didn't know.

Glimmer: [angrily, enunciating] Tell that to Mermista.

Swift Wind: Hey, where is Mermista?

[Scene transition to a bathroom in Bright Moon Castle]

[Mermista groans as she uses water magic to bring a tub of ice cream into the bathtub with her; bubbles pop and water runs]

Mermista: [depressed] Oh, look. More ice cream. Cause I'm the princess of ice cream now. [half-chuckles, half-sobs as she sinks under the water, bubbles flowing over the side]

[scene transition back to the war room]

Sea Hawk: [puts his hand to his mouth conspiratorially] She's, um, taking some "me time".

Bow: [feigning happy, attempting reassuring] "Me time"! Great... We all could use some of that. So let's check in with each other more often, and Glimmer if you could--

Glimmer: [slams hand on table; aggravated] I'm not going to hide inside the castle while our people are in danger. I'm the Queen. You don't give me orders.

Bow: [taken off-guard; quietly] O...kay, I get that you're upset, but--

Adora: [angrily] Don't talk to Bow like that.

Bow: Adora, it's fine, Glimmer's just--

Glimmer: I need to stop the Horde. Any way I can. ...We're done for today. [walks off]

Adora: [groans; quietly] Ugh, fine. Clearly, we aren't going to get anything done right now. [walks off]

[Spinnerella and Netossa slowly back away, their footsteps become faster as they get further away until a door slams shut]

Sea Hawk: All in all, not the worst meeting we've had.

Bow: [sighs, upper half thumping onto the table; quietly] I've never seen Glimmer like this. Or Adora. I just wish I knew how to help them.

Sea Hawk: [drags Bow up from the table, his body squeaking along it; he shakes him a little] Ah, don't blame yourself, lad. [suddenly happier] ...Hey, you know, I just had an idea, not pre-planned at all. Let's take a break and have a boys' night out on the town!

Swift Wind: [gasps excitedly] Can I come, too?

Bow: [sadly reserved] I should really stay here in case Glimmer and Adora need me...

Sea Hawk: One night off won't hurt. [places hands on Bow's shoulders] What do you say?

Swift Wind: [chanting, raising in volume and stamping his hooves] Boys' night out, boys' night out, boys' night out, BOYS' NIGHT OUT! [volume decreases] ...Why am I the only one doing this?

Bow: You know what? Why not?

Sea Hawk: Grand! [to himself, not really] And then my brilliant secret plan can begin...

Bow: What's that?

Sea Hawk: [spins Bow as he trills in a high pitch] Nothingggg! [Swift Wind hums and poses dramatically behind them] Forward to a friendship adventure!


[On the ocean outside Salineas, on a Horde ship]

[Hordak stands staring at the destruction of the Sea Gate as smoke billows and the wind whistles]

Catra: Lord Hordak. Sounds like congratulations are in order.

Hordak: [triumphantly] Yes... The princesses are in utter disarray...abandoning territory, scattering like cowards before us like the cowards they are.

Catra: [affirming] We're crushing them. Once you return to the Fright Zone, I'll march our troops on the rest of the coastal towns.

Hordak: No. Now that Horde Prime's arrival is imminent, I shall remain in the field to ensure victory. ...Besides. Out of all the princesses, Entrapta has yet to face me on the field...[laughs lowly]

Catra: [slightly annoyed] And what exactly am I supposed to do while you remain in the field?

Hordak: [authoritatively] Whatever I deem necessary to win. Return to your post in the Fright Zone and await my orders. [walks forward, closer to the front of the ship] ...Soon all of Etheria will be at my feet.

[Catra clenches her fist, then sighs, brushing back her hair; she presses her badge and it beeps, buzzing with radio static]

Catra: Force Captain Octavia, have you finished your perimeter?

Octavia, over the radio: We're doing the final sweep.

Catra: Excellent. Double Trouble should be breaking radio silence soon...they'll have new coordinates for you. [presses the badge and it beeps and buzzes again] Force Captain Scorpia, come in.

[nearby Horde soldiers carry a crate until they drop and one yells "Watch out!"; they grunt and cry out in pain]

Catra: Aw, man. Even when he's winning, Hordak is annoying. Now he suddenly loves fighting, and I'm getting stuck with whatever he [mimics Hordak in a lower tone] "deems necessary". [groans] Never thought I'd miss shut-in Hordak. [almost happily] Meet me at the Sea Gate, [quieter, tacked on quickly] I wanna take a break anyway.


[A bar in Seaworthy, arguably the one they first met Sea Hawk in]

[Medieval music plays in the background, as well as slight clinking of dishes/glasses and a low hum of conversation]

Bow: Sea Hawk, I thought you said boys' night out, it's the middle of day.

Sea Hawk: [eye twinkles, then cheers-ing his glass with Swift Wind; shouting] New experiences! [grabs Bow's wrist to clink his glass against theirs] Huzzah! [all glasses tap down on the table] Day, night, it matters not. You're overdue for some levity.

Bow: [sighs disheartenedly] Last time I was here it was with Adora and Glimmer, and...things were great... Not like now.

Sea Hawk: It is true. Things are looking...dour...

[Swift Wind gasps, Sea Hawk slurps his drink]

Sea Hawk: This drink is...extra sour...

[Swift Wind gasps more excitedly, almost shrieking]

Sea Hawk: Could be the Rebellion's...[slurps drink]...darkest...hour... [suddenly stands, spins, and slams his foot on their table] Nonsense! You know why? [a spotlight shuts on] Hit it!

[a patron at the bar nudges a snoring squeeze box player, who awakens and starts to play a jaunty toon]

Sea Hawk: [singing] Oh, when the seas are rough and dire / we turn to friends and we conspire / to relight the sacred fire / of rebellion! [He dances, pulling at his scarf and jumping on a table] When the Horde tightens their noose / around our daring sea rescues / we take some time to cut loose / from the rebellion! Sure friends aren't seeing eye to eye! / Tis no reason to curl up and die! [slides on his knees] Friendship just needs a resupply!

Swift Wind and Sea Hawk: [singing] Oh it's fun, it's fun to be friends with friends! / Oh it's fun, it's fun to be friends with friends!

Sea Hawk: And when Hordak hits us robotical / we'll respond with tunes most...nautical / and take a moment to...to... to, to, to, to [Bow hands him a bottle] t-uh, to pop! [pops cork out of a bottle] soda botticals! [liquid pours out on Bow's head]

[a sharp note cuts off, and a man coughing can be heard in the silence]

Swift Wind: Oh, man. Third rhyme. Rough stuff.

[the squeeze box resumes as Swift Wind clops up near Sea Hawk on the bar]

Sea Hawk and Swift Wind: [singing] Oh how fun, how fun to be friends with friends! / Oh how fun, how fun to be friends with friends!

[Bow slides up squeakily in front of them, posing dramatcally]

Bow: [singing, spinning with Sea Hawk and jumping down arm-in-arm] Sometimes we'll fight but that's okay, we'll work it out another day / I know things will work out in the end!

Sea Hawk: [singing] Oh, yes!

Sea Hawk, Bow, and Swift Wind: [singing] Cause it's fun to be friends with friends! / Oh it's fun to be friends with friends!

[the patrons of the bar cheer]

Sea Hawk, Bow, and Swift Wind: [singing, finalizing/enunciating] Oh it's fun to be friends with friends!

[blades shing as they are drawn from a booth at all three; the bar patrons can be heard]

Bow: [nervously] It's an ambush!

Sea Hawk: [happily, trills] Whoo, better! It's a kidnapping!

Bow: [noticing Sea Hawk offering his wrists; quietly, incredulous] Sea Hawk, what are you doing?!

Sea Hawk: Don't worry. It's all a part of my brilliant secret plan.

Swift Wind: [whispering, angrily] What plan?

Sea Hawk: To unite the princesses and cheer up my dearest Mermista. They love rescuing people...[smile shines] so I paid my friend Bill to kidnap us! [kidnapper ties rope around his hands; triumphantly] The ladies will put aside their problems to rescue us, go on a mission of fun, and then it's a happy ending for all!

Bow: [incredulous, angrily] Wait. You paid them to--[grunts when another kidnapper grabs his arms]

Sea Hawk: [a squeeze box plays a slower tune; singing] The princesses will stop their fight / When they save us, it'll be all right / We'll hang with Bill the rest / of the night / it's fun to be friends with friends...sha-boom-bity-boom-bam-boo... / Hey, Bill, did you get...taller? and when did you get that...scar? You, uh, you didn't...have a scar... [squeeze box cuts out] This might not be Bill. [squeeze box plays sour note; nervously] ...No, this isn't Bill.

Bow: [voice breaks, angrily shouting] What?!


[the deck of a ship out on the ocean]

[a cloth flutters as it is removed from over Bow and the others; Bow screams when he opens his eyes]

Swift Wind: [whispers urgently] What do we do?

Bow: [whispers] We have to get a message to our friends. Swift Wind, try to contact Adora through your sacred bond.

Sea Hawk: [nervously] Yeah, yeah, yes-yes. My plan can still work. They'll just unite to rescue us for real this time.[laughs nervously] Nothing's spun out of control...[chuckles slightly] Do your thing, noble steed.

Swift Wind: [grunts as he channels magic energy to his horn] Come on, Adora, pick up. [grunts as the energy starts to be sent out] Pick up...

[scene transition to Bright Moon Castle, a hallway]

Glimmer: [to a door] Mermista? Are you alone?

Mermista: [from inside the room, depressed] Totally...

[The door squeaks open and Glimmer gasps at Adora, who is using her sword transformed into a mop to mop water off the floor; its squelching stops when Glimmer clears her throat]

Glimmer: I thought you said you were alone?

Mermista: [depressed] I am... Deep down inside...so...alone... [Adora continues mopping; Mermista scoffs slightly] Are you two gonna fight again? [sinks further into the bathtub, water bubbling] Whatever...

[Bubbles pop up from the tub as Glimmer and Adora stare at each other]

Glimmer: I was just...checking up on Mermista, but, clearly, you have it covered. [walks away]

[The sword transforms back into a vambrace as Adora follows; the door shuts and Adora grabs Glimmer's wrist]

Adora: [attempts reassuring] Glimmer, what is going on with you? I know things are bad right now, but...we can fix it--

Glimmer: [throws arm out of Adora's grip; angrily] Why is that always your answer to everything?!

Adora: [slowly, angrily] Because it's the only thing we can do.

Glimmer: [angrily] Things are worse than ever. The Horde has Salineas, the coast is falling, we haven't FIXED anything!

Adora: [frustratedly] That's why we need to work together instead of you pushing us away, and if you'd just listened to us, you'd know that, [manically, tone pitching higher] and why can I hear the ocean right now?!


[the boys on the ship]

[Magic sound effects as Swift Wind channels Adora]

Bow: Anything?

Swift Wind: [grunts] Ah! She hung up on me. But I could tell that she's in distress... I-I should be at her side, right now! [grunts, straining against the ropes holding them to the mast]

Bow: [reassuringly] Swift Wind, calm. Down. It'll be okay. We'll figure something out.

Sea Hawk: Fear not. I know how to get a message to my sweet Mermista. After all...she taught me how to speak [trills] seagullllll! [eye sparkles; begins cawing erratically; a seagull on the sail squawks and flies to land on his head, preening] ...I may be a bit rusty.

Not Bill: What's all this yammering about?

[The three kidnappers stand a bit away; the leader takes off his mask]

Sea Hawk: [tone pitched up] Admiral--! [clears throat; nervous] Admiral Scurvy, my old friend...[chuckles nervously] It's just like you to, uh, take over someone else's jovial prank... Isn't it fun being friends? [half chuckle; begins to sing] Oooohhh--!

Scurvy: [sword shings cutting through Sea Hawk's ropes] Absolutely not! [grabs Sea Hawk, pointing his blade at him] Friends? Heh. We were friends. But I've had to rebuild my last three ships because you set them on fire. [tosses Sea Hawk toward the gangplank] Honestly, who does that?!

[Sea Hawk half-cries out as he almost steps off the end of the plank, the waves whoosh; Scurvy's blade shings as he points it at Sea Hawk]

Sea Hawk: [yelps; then disarmingly] Come on, now, Scurvy...isn't this all just a bit extreme? [nervous chuckle]

[Scurvy takes more steps toward Sea Hawk who almost loses balance and flails, vocalizing in fear; the seagull from earlier squawks and flies off]

Bow: Admiral Scurvy! ...Sir! Whatever Sea Hawk has done in the past...can't you put that aside for the sake of your friendship?

[All three kidnappers laugh]

Scurvy: Friendship? Whoo, boy... [points sword back at Sea Hawk] Listen up, kid. Friendship [through clenched teeth] is overrated. [Sea Hawk yelps] There's only one thing in this world that matters...money. And lucky for you, the three of you have some value to me yet.

[Scurvy lifts his sword away; Scurvy's crew tighten Sea Hawk back to the mast]

Sea Hawk: This was all a terrible idea. Why didn't anyone stop me?

Swift Wind: [straining against ropes to look around at Sea Hawk; angrily, shouting] Because you didn't tell us. Why didn't you tell us?!

Sea Hawk: [angrily] If I told you, you would have stopped me.

Bow: [attempts reassurance] ...It's okay! [sings] 'Cause it's fun to be friends with friends! [hopeful] Remember?

Sea Hawk: [voice breaks] This is no time for songs.

Swift Wind: Yeah, read the room, Bow.

Bow: [hopefully] Look, as soon as they realize we're gone, Adora and Glimmer will stop fighting and come for us. I know they will.

[the waves on the ocean whoosh as the ship sails away]


[Outside the Sea Gate]

Catra: [presses her badge, it beeps and buzzes with radio static] Hey, Scorpia. Where are you? It's not like you to be late. [radio static continues; Catra curls her tail around her legs and hugs her knees; quietly] ...Listen, I'll kill you if you tell anyone this, but... I thought winning would be...different. Or at least, more... [clicks her tongue] I don't know... Fun?

[radio static continues]

Catra: Come on. You're not still mad about before... Are ya? [frustratedly] Stop being so sensitive. Get over it and talk to me, Scorpia.

[radio static continues]

Catra: ...Scorpia? [almost desperately] ...Scorpia?!

[Catra grunts as she leaps down from atop the statues at the Sea Gate]


[the boys on the ship]

[Bow and Sea Hawk grunt as they struggle with their rope restraints; Scurvy walks up]

Scurvy: Good news, boys. Someone cared enough about you three, [happily] to pay a hefty ransom!

[The boys laugh and cheer]

Sea Hawk: The princesses...of course! Just like I planned.

Scurvy: [laughs] All that very loud, very public singing about the Rebellion, and you think your ransom was paid by the princesses?

[A ship foghorn blows]

Scurvy: The Horde controls the seas now. And they're paying top dollar for high-ranking Rebel prisoners.

Octavia: [throws a bag of coins that jingle at Scurvy] As promised.

Sea Hawk: [quietly, imploringly] Scurvy...don't do this.You and I lived by a sacred code...the law of the sea. We are like brothers... If our friendship ever meant anything to you--

Scurvy: [deadpan] It didn't.

[A Horde metal ramp scrapes down to land on Scurvy's ship; Horde soldiers march down to the boys, and Sea Hawk grunts as they take him away]

Scurvy: [coin bag jingling; to Bow] Your friends aren't coming, kid. I don't think they've even noticed you're gone. [laughs, walking away; sighs] Oh, friends...

[A soldier steps up to take Bow]


[Bright Moon Castle, the hallway outside the bathroom and inside]

[Glimmer and Adora can be heard arguing, muffled inside the bathroom where Mermista sinks lower into her tub; the seagull that Sea Hawk spoke to flies in and lands on Mermista's tail, squawking, until she gasps; some things that can be heard overlapping while this happens are:

Glimmer: Just because you're She-Ra doesn't mean you can order people around!

Adora: You just keep pushing us away!

Glimmer: I am Queen of Etheria, okay? Not--

Adora: --and going rogue and leaving! What are we supposed to do with that? We're trying our best!]

Glimmer: [angrily] You think you can just transform into She-Ra, and hit things with your sword, and it will fix everything! Well, guess what: It's not working!

Adora: [imploring] Why are you blaming this all on me? It's not my fault that Salineas fell! The Horde manipulated all of us!

Glimmer: [angrily] She-Ra was supposed to save us. But the Rebellion's in a worse place than ever since you showed up!

Adora: [upset] I'm trying my best. Why can't you see that?

Glimmer: [angrily] Well, maybe your best isn't good enough. If it was, my mother would still be here!

[Adora breathes in as she begins to sob; Glimmer gasps]

Glimmer: [retracting, apologetically] Adora--Adora I'm I'm sorry...

[Both gasp in surprise as the bathroom door bursts open]

Mermista: [shouts, determined] The boys are in trouble! A seagull told me! I may have lost my kingdom, but I'm not losing anyone else. [happily] Sea-Ra is back in action! [grabs Glimmer's and Adora's hands, they gasp/shout as she tugs them] Let's go!


[The Horde ship ferrying the boys treads the waves, making the wake crash]

[seagulls squawk overhead]

Sea Hawk: So...what happened to the eye?

Octavia: Oh, [chuckles slightly] this? Catra scratched it out when she was six. And now... [maliciously] I bet she's gonna do the exact same thing to all of you! [charges stun baton, electricity zapping]

Bow: [disheartened] I don't care.

Octavia: Hey! I'm threatening you.

Bow: [shouts] I don't care! [still upset, but normal volume] You know what? It's not easy being the friendly and upbeat guy all the time. And I get that it's hard being friends sometimes. You gotta work at it. ...So why am I always the only one who's willing to work at it? I mean...they didn't even notice I'm gone. ...Do whatever you want. I don't care. It's terrible being friends with friends.

Octavia: [backing up, scoffing] Oh, yeesh. [presses her badge, it beeps and buzzes with radio static] Ready at the rendezvous point. You guys gotta get this kid off my ship, he's bringing me down. ...Scorpia? ...Scorpia, come in.

Soldier: Force Captain Octavia, we got magic incoming!

Octavia: [incredulous] What?!

[Glimmer, Mermista, and Adora teleport in, grunting]

Adora: [shouts] For the Honor of Grayskull!

[She-Ra transformation theme]

[She-Ra lands with a grunt, expelling a wave of magic energy that knocks some soldiers back as they shout; Glimmer teleports over to Bow, blasting the ropes off him and the other two; Sea Hawk and Swift Wind run off, laughing and shouting]

Glimmer: [pushes Bow away after helping him to his feet] Look out! [blasts magic at a soldier, sending them flying and shouting]

Sea Hawk: [shouts as he punches soldiers; happily] Mermista! You're back in the game!

Mermista: [determinedly] Never felt better. [blasts a wave of water magic, tamping her staff down] Rescuing people is my jam.

Sea Hawk: I knew it! Never doubted my brilliant plan for a moment. [begins to sing] Oh, how fun--[Mermista blasts water magic at a soldier, knocking them off the ship; Sea Hawk vocalizes]

Mermista: No shanties! [electric guitar strums] Hit it.

Sea Hawk: [gasps excitedly] I thought you said no shanties?

Mermista: This isn't a shanty, it's like a rock remix, so...it's cool.

[Rock music plays; the squad fights as Mermista starts to sing]

Mermista: [singing] You can't keep me down / Can't throw this princess around / 'Cause you know how this all ends

Sea Hawk: [singing] With punches and kicks / And magical tricks / On each other we all depend

Mermista: [singing] I'll blast you away / And fight another day / For Salineas!

Mermista and Sea Hawk: [singing] Yeah, it's fun to fight hard with friends!

[they alternate]

S: Fight with friends!

M: Fight with friends!

S: Fight with friends!

Mermista and Sea Hawk: [singing] It's hard to fight with friends!

[She-Ra fights off soldiers who grunt and shout, until she is backed against Glimmer; they share a look and then hold hands a moment, magic energy ringing, then fight together, grunting and shouting; Bow sees this and joins the singing]

Bow, Sea Hawk, and Mermista: [singing] Yeah, it's fun to fight hard with friends!

[They alternate, singing as She-Ra and Glimmer look at and then away from each other]

B: Fight with friends!

S: Fight with friends!

Bow, Sea Hawk, and Mermista: [singing] Fight with friends!

S: Fight with friends!

Bow, Mermista, and Sea Hawk: [singing] It's hard to fight with friends!

[A soldier falls off the ship, shouting and splashing into the sea; Octavia surfaces in the ocean, grunting in anger; the squad besides Glimmer and She-Ra cheer; Sea Hawk can be heard saying "Adventure!" and "Friendship!"; Bow attempts to embrace Glimmer and She-Ra together, but they walk away from each other]


[The Fright Zone, Scorpia's room]

[The door whirs open and Catra runs in]

Catra: Scorpia? [she steps further in] ...Scorpia? [her badge beeps on along with buzzing static, repeating her call over the radio in the badge on Scorpia's bed; the badge beeps off as Catra picks up Scorpia's badge, jacket from the Crimson Waste, and a note]

[Catra flips open the note and gasps lightly; the badge clatters to the floor, along with the jacket flumping and paper fluttering down as Catra drops them]


[A Rebellion ship, sailing away as the ocean wind is heard]

Sea Hawk: [triumphantly] And that is the tale of how I united everyone with my brilliant plan!

Mermista: Whatever, you goober. [punches Sea Hawk lightly in the gut, and he grunts] Your plan was terrible. [determined] But I'm done moping in a bathtub. [spins staff, tamping it down as a wave washes behind her] I'm ready to fight, to destroy the Horde and get my kingdom back!

Sea Hawk: That's my girl!

Mermista: Also, Bright Moon ran out of ice cream.

Sea Hawk: That's also my girl!

[Both laugh; their conversation continues as Bow looks on at Glimmer and Adora; some things that can be heard are:

Sea Hawk: Sea Hawk--

Mermista: We should always fight to music. It's awesome.]

[Glimmer attempts to place a hand on Adora's arm, but Adora slaps her hand away and runs off; Glimmer sighs in frustration and walks the opposite direction; Bow walks over to Adora]

Bow: Adora, you and Glimmer--

Adora: [sighs; quietly, determined, somber] I know what I have to do, Bow. I'm going to look for Mara's weapon. The one she mentioned in the message. Maybe it can turn the tide of the war for us. ...It has to.

Bow: What are you talking about? Glimmer doesn't need a weapon, she needs her friends.

Adora: [quietly] No, she doesn't. [hops down from the side of the ship to the deck] But it doesn't matter. I will fix this...no matter what Glimmer thinks of me.

Sea Hawk: [happily singing, playing a squeeze box] The Best Friends Squad on the sea / we subdued the threat / the threat with ease / we sail the world / come near or far / we're best friends we are, we are / we're best friends, we are, we are!

Bow: [singing along with the last line, quietly, somberly] We're best friends, we are...we are...
