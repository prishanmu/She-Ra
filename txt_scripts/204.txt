She-Ra: [breathes out] Ooh, okay. We need to find a way to reclaim the Horde-occupied fortress for The Rebellion. So how are we gonna do this?

Glimmer: I'll teleport ahead to scout out a path through their defenses.

Bow: And I'll quietly shoot the closest turrets with my trick-arrows. [arrow he holds up shings]

She-Ra: You'll have the advantage in a sneak-attack. ...Go!

[A bird chirps, perched atop a Horde turret; the guard manning the turret yawns; Glimmer teleports behind the guard and whacks them with her staff; a guard grunts as She-Ra punches them; more guards grunt when Bow shoots them with goo arrows]

Bow: [triumphantly] Yes! And now--[grunts as he falls after being blasted by a turret shot]

[She-Ra gasps as she and Glimmer look over the wall to where Bow falls into the valley, wind blowing; Glimmer sobs]

She-Ra: [disbelief, sadly] He's...dead...

[Transition to the inside of a tent in a nearby rebellion camp]

[Tiny Bow figurine clatters on the table]

Bow: [groans, upset] Oh, what?! [shouts] Tiny Bow, you will be avenged! [sobs, grunts when he slams his upper half down on the table]

Adora: [groans] That clearly isn't going to work. Let's try this again. [sits She-Ra figurine down on the table]

[Opening Theme]


[Rebellion Camp, tent]

Bow: [annoyed] I shouldn't be dead. That turret came out of nowhere...

Glimmer: That's because you failed to make a successful observation check. If we're going to retake the pass, we have to be prepared for anything.

Adora: The pass is the only way in or out of this region. According to the reports, the Horde seized it while we were busy defending Bright Moon, [places pawn on map] so it's crucial that we get it back.

Bow: [half-whine] Why does that mean I have to die? And after I made these for you.

Adora: [puts her hands to her temples, frustrated] Look, our plans always fall apart. [raises pitch] Always! [normal tone] It would be impressive if it wasn't terrifying.

Glimmer: [positively] We have gotten really good at improvising, though.

Adora: [sighs] If we're gonna pull this off, we need to come up with a plan that won't fall apart, [increasing frustration] and a plan that takes into account everything the Horde could possibly throw at us, including surprise attacks.

Bow: Okay, but you're breaking Tiny Bow's heart. [gestures to Tiny Bow figurine] I mean, look at his face!

Glimmer: [unimpressed] He's smiling.

Bow: Through his pain, Glimmer. [whispers urgently] Through his pain!

Adora: [serious] Guys, this pass is important. The Horde is not going to give it up without a fight. It's obviously going to be guarded by their very best and brightest...

[Scene transition to on top of the Horde outpost wall]

Scorpia: [calling out] Move those big weapon-y things! [many soldiers on the ground level scurry about, gasping in hasty compliance] Flap those banners! Uh--keep doing whatever it is you're doing, guy I'm pointing at! Now do a different thing! And look sharp, Force Captain's orders!

[Scorpia turns to Lonnie, Kyle, and Rogelio standing on the wall with her]

Scorpia: [happy disbelief] Catra left me in charge. Me. Can you believe it?!

Lonnie: Uh, no. I really can't.

Scorpia: [leans back up against the railing] Ah, me neither. [wistful] She must really trust me... [determined] I can't let her down. [shouting] Kyle! Man the parapets!

Kyle: [confidently confused] I don't know what those are.

Scorpia: [shouting] Then find out!

[Kyle runs away slowly, panting]

Scorpia: [sighs, quoting Catra in a similar tone to Catra's normal authoritative one] "Scorpia, you're in charge of the fortress," she said. "Even you can't mess this up," she said. [wistful] Even me. She's thinking about me! [sighs] Ah... [genuine, serious, wondering] Should I get her a 'Thank You' gift? What's her favorite color? [shouts immediately] KYLE, what are you doing?!

Kyle: [standing on the nearby parapets] Uh, you said--I--

Scorpia: [shouts] Go find out Catra's favorite color!

[Kyle runs past slowly the opposite direction, panting; Scorpia turns to Lonnie and Rogelio, who quickly begin to try to walk away]

Scorpia: [softly] Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey--[Rogelio squeals in a reptilian manner and Lonnie grunts as Scorpia grabs both of them and puts her claws around their shoulders]--you guys know Catra. W-what would she like? I need it to be something that says...[Rogelio snorts] 'Thank you', but also--[Lonnie and Rogelio grunt again as Scorpia squeezes both into a headlock]--'We are soulmates tied together by the beautiful threads of fate...'

Lonnie: [grunts with effort as she pushes Scorpia's claw off her] We should spend less time talking about Catra, and more time talking about the defenses.

[Silence as Scorpia blinks at Lonnie]

Lonnie: [frustrated] The reason we're here!

[Scorpia laughs heartily as she pats Lonnie's back that she grunts in surprise as she's thrown to the railing, coughing over it]

Scorpia: Okay, you don't need to remind me. My wildcat is counting on me, and I won't [thumps her claws down hard on the railing] let her down. [places one foot on the railing, pointing out over it; determined, valorous] For Catra, I will defend this pass with my very life!

Lonnie: [coughs to punctuate] Wrong pass.

Scorpia: [runs over to the correct side of the wall] Yes, this is the pass I will defend with my very life. No reason to worry at all.


[Rebellion camp, tent]

Adora: Clearly, that last plan won't work. So maybe, if we try sneaking past the turrets from a different side--

Glimmer: [takes the strategist's divider from in front of Adora] You're going about this all wrong. We're not going to win by sneaking. We gotta take the action [slams divider down] to them!

[scene transition to Glimmer's view of how the plan should go

[art style changes and her eye shines with a shing; She-Ra and Bow stand a ways away as Glimmer leans against a rock]

Glimmer: [attempts to sound tough] Just let Glimmer handle this. [winks, shines with a shing] Using my awesome powers of teleportation--[teleports into outpost, turrets surround her and charge up]--I take out their first line of defense!

[Glimmer imitates a explosion sounds and knocks over pawns on the Map table]

Glimmer: [Glimmer teleports onto the wall in front of Lonnie, Kyle, and Rogelio] Then, I teleport over the wall and take out a line of soldiers with one CRITICAL strike! [Glimmer charges a glitter bomb in her fist]

[Glimmer knocks over another pawn with her Glimmer figurine, imitating more explosion sounds; she yells out triumphantly]

Glimmer: I back-flip, front-flip, back-flip into a teleport, poof! THEN, I take out a super-bot, and it EXPLODES!

Glimmer: [imitates more explosion noises as a bot blows up behind her] And I'm past the wall--[teleporting]--I'm unstoppable, I'M--

Bow: You ran out of teleports, like, 12 teleports ago.

Glimmer: Then, I land on you! [both shouting as Glimmer falls onto Bow in an explosive dust cloud]

[Scene transition back to reality; Glimmer drops her figurine on top of Bow's]

Bow: [upset, shouting] Tiny Bow! Nooooo! [collapses back onto beanbag with a thud]

Adora: [fatigued] Glimmer, we need to come up with a plan based on reality.

Glimmer: [picks up divider, agreeing with some mirth] Yes, and in that moment, I really would land on Bow.

Adora: [takes the divider back, considering] Hmm. Using a limited number of teleports isn't a bad idea... So, Glimmer will take Bow--

[scene transition to Adora's view of the plan]

Adora: --and, using her powers, [Glimmer teleports Bow] teleport him into the turrets' blind spot. Bow shall act as backup [Glimmer teleports beside She-Ra as she climbs up the wall] while you and I breach the less-patrolled area up on the wall. [both Glimmer and Adora grunt in distress as a large rumbling is heard, shaking the wall; a giant Mermista steps loudly into frame]

Mermista: Uh...

[scene transition back to reality]

Mermista: ...Why are you playing with dolls?

Adora: [slams hands on table, frustrated, voice pitched higher] We're not playing with dolls!

Bow: [confidently at first] Yeah! They're war-table battle figures--a-and I don't know if I have one for you. Hold on. [rummages through his bag]

Glimmer: Wait a minute. Aren't you supposed to be on watch?

Mermista: [turns to look at the outpost outside the tent entrance, then back; feigning interest] Oh, look, the fortress is still there, like it was an hour ago. Watch complete.

[Glimmer groans in annoyance; Bow continues rummaging]

Mermista: [disarmingly] Relax, I switched with Perfuma. [sits]

Adora: We're still coming up with a plan.

Mermista: Am I in the plan?

Adora: We're getting to--

Bow: I don't have you, buuut I do have a seashell and a happy otter?

Mermista: [disinterested] Uhhh, googly eyes? [Bow shakes the seashell and the eyes rattle] ...Pass.

Bow: [offended] Wha--?!

Adora: Can we please get back to--

Mermista: [taking She-Ra figurine] I'll be She-Ra.

Adora: [scoffs] You can't be She-Ra. I'm She-Ra.

Mermista: Not anymore. Ya snooze, ya lose--[Glimmer growls and Mermista grunts as Glimmer tackles her; she teleports them both outside the tent, then Glimmer takes the figurine from Mermista's hand and teleports back]

Mermista: Uh, wow, rude much?

[Scene transition to wall of the Horde outpost]

[Lonnie holds a beeping tablet]

Lonnie: [turning to nearby guard] Alert Force Captain Scorpia. We've got a princess problem.


[Rebellion camp, tent]

Glimmer: [teleporting in to sit at the table] I admit, I got a little carried away. But the rest of my plan could work.

Adora: [seriously] Except that you're not taking the biggest variable into account: Catra. She's been behind every Horde plan, she led the attack on Bright Moon, she's devious--

Glimmer: [smugly] And I've already thought of that.

[Scene transition to Glimmer's view of the plan]

Glimmer: [standing with She-Ra and Bow behind her] I knew destroying the bots would lure her out.

Glimmer's Catra: [steps forward; laughs humorlessly; with an authoritative air of elegance] And so it has, Glimmer. [Rolls a purr and meows]

She-Ra: [snorts a little in humorous disbelief] This is how you see Catra?

Bow: [laughs a little] Yeah, this seems a little off.

She-Ra: [laughs] A little?

Glimmer's Catra: You fell into my trap. I've armed the tower with a bomb, capable of taking out my greatest enemy--[whip noise as she points] you.

Glimmer: Do you expect us to just sit here?!

Glimmer's Catra: No, princess, I expect you to di--

[Perfuma chuckles and bursts in]

Perfuma: I cast Giant Flytrap on Catra!

[A giant flytrap plant comes out behind Catra and growls, closing in; Catra shrieks and jumps out of the way; Glimmer teleports; She-Ra gasps a 'whoa' and moves; Bow sobs and takes it, the flytrap's jaws clamping shut]

[Scene transitions back to reality]

Perfuma: [a venus flytrap plant she's holding has Tiny Bow's figurine in its mouth; apologetic] Oops, sorry Bow.

Glimmer: Ugh! What are you doing here?

Frosta: Mermista said you were playing a battle game. We wanna join!

Adora: [groans lightly] We are in the middle of a very serious planning session.

Perfuma: [happily] We have lots of ideas for plans!

Glimmer: Aren't you on watch right now?!

Adora: [groans in consideration] Okay, but only if you guys are serious about the--

Frosta: [happily] I'm sitting next to Glimmer!

[The group converses in a cacophony; some things that are said include:

Bow: What does that flytrap normally eat?

Frosta: I have amazing ideas, starting with we PUNCH them!

Mermista: Anyone else hungry? I am hungry.]

[Adora grunts lightly in nervous discomfort]


[Horde outpost, on the wall]

[Rogelio holds a tiny bot in his hand]

Scorpia: Spy Bot, the mission is simple, I need you to spy on the princesses so I can stop them, and impress Catra so much she'll finally admit we're best friends, or at the very least, we have a bond that can never be broken. You got that?

Lonnie: Uh, it's not turned on, and, um, that's not how it works.

[silence as Scorpia looks back and forth between the bot and Lonnie and Rogelio]

Scorpia: Good, good! Yeah, I was just testing you on whether you knew how to do--that, and...you passed, so...kudos.

[silence as Lonnie and Rogelio share a look]

Scorpia: [confidently, triumphantly] Now, let's go spy!

[Lonnie clears her throat and hands Scorpia the control remote; Scorpia taps it once with her claw and Lonnie quickly presses a button that beeps; the bot powers up with whirs and beeps and turns in Rogelio's hand; it registers Scorpia through its eye]

Scorpia: [in endearment] Aww, aren't you the cutest little fella! Look at you with your little legs and your antenna. You're just about the cutest thing I've ever--[Lonnie clears her throat loudly]--Spying. Yes. That is the thing...that we are. Doing.

[Scorpia grunts in contemplation, and taps at the remote with a claw; the bot whirs without doing anything; she taps at the remote furiously, still not pressing any buttons; suddenly, she almost drops the remote and juggles it, grunting in surprise; she groans lightly in distress]

Scorpia: [sighs, looks at Lonnie] Second test...

Lonnie: [deadpan] Do you want me to drive the Spy Bot?

Scorpia: [shamelessly handing Lonnie the remote] Yes, please.


[Rebellion camp, tent]

Bow: Okay, everyone has a figure, except Perfuma who's using her plant, and Mermista who has...that for some reason. [eyes Sea-Ra figure, literally Mermista with a starfish breastplate, different crown, opposable joints, and much larger than any other figure]

Mermista: Says the guy with a bag of dolls.

Bow: [frustratedly] They're war-table battle figures!

Adora: Okay, so I'm thinking--

Bow: Hold on. [takes the divider from Adora; enunciates] So far I have shot, eaten, and squashed. We're doing my plan. And there will be no death, no dying, just heroic good times.

[Scene transition to Bow's view of the plan; scene is artistically similar to 80's She-Ra in terms of costumes, scenery, sound effects, and Catra's character]

Bow: [with confidence] I am Bow. She-Ra's best friend, and defender of Etheria. [comical ding as he smiles; lands inside the outpost] When the evil Horde strikes, I strike back. [readies to shoot an arrow as sparkles and sparkle noises surround him]

[The rest of the crew appear behind him]

Perfuma: [happily] Ooh, we all get hats!

Mermista: [groans in disgust] Ugh...

Bow: [lets the arrow fly] After I destroy the turrets with my trick arrows, Glimmer teleports us to the tower. [crew teleports inside] There, someone waits in the shadows...[a meowing maniacal laugh can be heard] ...Catra.

Bow's Catra: [speaks with catlike inflections and sounds embedded as puns; meows] Fools. I won't let you destroy my [rolls r] purrrfect plan.

Adora: [yells incredulously] What??

Glimmer: [laughs] This is kind of amazing...

Bow: [joins in on the cat puns] It looks like I've got you meow, evil doer!

Bow's Catra: I'd paws to reflect on your upcoming death if I were mew.

Bow: I don't know, I'm feline pretty good right now.

Adora: Ooh, stop. You gotta stop.

Mermista: [groans] Now we're all hoping this plan kills us.

Bow's Catra: Then [rolls r] purrrr-pare to meet your end! [slides mask down over her eyes and transforms into a big cat and caterwauls]

Frosta: [almost impressed] Wait, she can do that?!

Bow: [slightly nervously] No, but I-I ran out of figures and only have this left, so she can now. [serious] ...Also, the Horde has dragons because I did not make enough robots.

[Dragon roars]

Bow: Not to worry, I'll shoot her with my net arrow! [releases arrow]

[The arrow misses Catra as she ducks and caterwauls in surprise; the arrows ricochets off the walls with a comedic bounce sound effect]

[Scene transitions back to reality]

[Tiny Bow figurine clatters over on the table and a plastic net falls on top of him]

Bow: [stands up; frustrated] Oh, come on!

Adora: [scoffs] She would obviously duck. You can't underestimate Catra or the Horde. ...Now, I think we can exploit a weakness in the wall--

Perfuma: [enthusiastically] Is it my turn?

Adora: [annoyed] This isn't a GAME.

Perfuma: I use my magic to grow a Plant Golem to take down the tower!

[scene transitions to Perfuma's view of the plan]

[thunderous footsteps rattle the ground and rocks under Horde soldier's feet; Perfuma stands atop the outpost wall and shouts as the Plant Golem rises up behind her and mirrors her with a roar; vines sweep past screaming Horde soldiers]

[Bow's hand raises and the scene transitions to reality]

Bow: If it's made out of plants, how does it roar?

Perfuma: [chuckles into her hand; conspiratorially] It's plant magic!

Adora: [sighs and slams the table with both hands; attempting to be calm, but is annoyed] Perfuma, we're not just making up whatever we want.

Mermista: Plus, your idea is dumb.

Perfuma: [scoffs] And what would you do?

Mermista: [chuckles slightly] Uh, I step forward and I say--

[Scene transition to Mermista's view of the plan

[Horde soldiers grunt, shaking their heads after being hit with Perfuma's golem; the soldiers gasp at Mermista, now riding a wave of water above the wall]

Mermista: [regally] I am Mermista. Fabulous secrets were revealed to me in the day that I held aloft my trident and said, "For the Honor of Gray Whales!" [trident's stone shines; Mermista transforms into Sea-Ra]

[A dolphin whinnies and passes by to transition out of Mermista's view of the plan]

Mermista: [makes hand motions; deadpans] Then it's like sparkle, sparkle, dolphin, sparkle.

Adora: [through clenched teeth; aggravated] Mermista...

Mermista: [continues deadpanning] I get shoes that are slightly better than my normal shoes, there's probably another dolphin...

Adora: [yells, angrily] Mermista!

Mermista: Then, like, I twirl and my hair does this thing [brushes her ponytail] where it looks all messy, but it's actually, like, really super-beautiful...

Adora: [grabs the front of Mermista's shirt and yanks her up to her face; angrily, enunciating] You can't transform into She-Ra!

Mermista: [unfazed] Uh, duh, I'm Sea-Ra. Princess of the Oceans, obviously. [scoffs]

Perfuma: [stutters, upset] No, i-i-if-if she gets to be Sea-Ra, I get to have a Plant Golem.

Frosta: [tosses out her arm in a flourish] The Winter's Bane needs no help from a plant...

Adora: [incredulous] The what?!

[Scene transition to Frosta's view of the plan]

[A winter wind blows through the wall of the outpost; snow begins to fall; soldiers are all frozen in different forms of running away]

Frosta: [toughly] My enemies know me as Frostbite Winter's Bane. [more softly] My friends call me Bane. [returns to tough tone] That is, if I had any. But no one comes close to the Winter's Bane!

[Frosta, armored in ice completely, artistically styled differently with one eye closed, stands in a hole made in the wall of the outpost; her sword makes a metallic shing]

[An explosion happens behind her and transitions out of Frosta's view of the plan]

Frosta: [excitedly] She's got an obsidian broadsword that enhances plus three, [points at her drawing of the Winter's Bane] and her finishing move is: the Snowstrike!

Mermista: [pokes at the drawing] What's that pink blob next to her?

Frosta: [still excitedly] Her sidekick: Glimmer.

Glimmer: [shocked anger] What?!

Adora: [whines, half pouts] We're getting so far from the real plan. Can we please focus?!

Glimmer: Yeah. Focus on how I'm not a sidekick!

[The group continues to discuss now over each other in a cacophony as the Spy Bot walks up and whirs; it makes its way into the tent and whirs as its lens registers the inside]


[Horde outpost, atop the wall]

[Lonnie, Scorpia, Kyle, and Rogelio stand huddled in front of the Spy Bot's remote]

Lonnie: We've got visual. Turning on the audio. [the remote beeps as the audio is turned on]

[On the remote's screen]

Perfuma: [excitedly] My army of Plant Golems will take down the tower instantly!

Frosta: [excitedly] Frostbite uses Snowstrike to encase the tower in ice and then crack it apart...KAPOW!

Mermista: Uh, you mean Sea-Ra will use the Trident of Power to blow it up.

Glimmer: [annoyed] You don't have a Trident of Power!

Mermista: [groans] Bow, make me a Trident of Power.

Bow: [sadly] I just don't wanna die again...

Scorpia: [walks away] I can't believe it...

Lonnie: Me either.

Scorpia: [laughs humorlessly; hopelessly] They're gonna give us frostbite, then attack us with a Plant Golem, and a woman named Sea-Ra?! [with more volume] And Bow's got a Trident of Power?! Who knows what that does! Oh, we're doomed!

Lonnie: [groans lightly] Ugh, they're obviously just coming up with ideas. Terrible ideas!

Scorpia: We cannot risk it.

[Scorpia thrusts herself between Lonnie and Rogelio, causing Rogelio to squeal in surprise; she reaches for the remote in Lonnie's hands]

Scorpia: Get in closer! [the remote beeps as she and Lonnie struggle]

Lonnie: [yells] Hey! Get off of me!

[Scene transition to the rebellion camp inside the tent; the robot beeps and whirs, beginning to make erratic movements; the cacophony of discussion in the tent can be heard to a degree:

Mermista: [smugly] Maybe we should throw Bow over the wall...

Bow: [angrily] Maybe we should throw everyone else over the wall!

Adora: [angrily] There goes taking this seriously! ]

[Mermista uncaps a drink with a grunt and the liquid spews out and drops onto the robot; it sparks with electricity and whirs in malfunction; it scurries out of the tent and whirs as it powers down]

[Scene transition back to the Horde outpost where Lonnie is now on Scorpia's back as they look at the remote's screen in Scorpia's claws]

Scorpia: Nooo! Kyle, go grab one of the other Spy Bots you packed!

Kyle: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Was that my job?

[They all disapprovingly say/gesture things including:

Scorpia: Really, Kyle? I don't know how you haven't been fired.

Lonnie: Kyle!

Rogelio: [growls and shakes his head] ]


[Rebellion camp, inside the tent]

[This scene has a lot of back and forth between each individual's plan and reality where Adora becomes increasingly more agitated]

[Glimmer's view of the plan]

Glimmer: I teleport in--[teleports]

[Reality]

Adora: And run out of teleports.

[Perfuma's view]

Perfuma: My Plant Golem tears down the wall! [Plant Golem punches through the wall]

[Reality]

Adora: The Horde will set it on fire.

[Frosta's view]

Frosta: Frostbite smashes the wall! [Frostbite leaps and shines, coming down hard to smash the wall]

[Reality]

Adora: The ice armor cracks as soon as you hit stone.

[Mermista's view]

Mermista: Sea-Ra destroy's the Horde bots! [Sea-Ra rides a wave that washes away the bots]

[Reality]

Adora: [angrily] There is no Sea-Ra, and you guys aren't taking Catra into account!

Perfuma: Oh, sure we are, see?

[scene transition to She-Ra standing in front of the outpost with several different versions of Catra spawning around her as the others tell their version]

Perfuma's Catra: [spoken as if slightly pouting angrily] I have a lot of negative things to say, and I hate flowers. >:(

Frosta: No, no, she's more like--

Frosta's Catra: [latches onto She-Ra's back with a glass in hand and her Princess Prom outfit on (with sunglasses)] I love ruining parties!

Glimmer: [laughs maniacally as her Catra]

Glimmer's Catra: [leans up against Adora] I'm a monster!

Bow: [meows as his Catra] What a--

Bow's Catra: --purr-fectly evil group!

[Bow's Catra meows and Glimmer's Catra laughs while She-Ra shrugs out from underneath all of them and shouts "No!"]

[Back to reality]

Adora: [angrily] None of this is right!

[Everyone groans tiredly]

Glimmer: [fatigued] We've been here for hours. [more enthusiastically] It's time we attack!

Adora: [seriously] The Horde will counter whatever we throw at them. We're gonna go again, and we're not gonna leave until we have a perfect plan.

Bow: ...Adora, isn't this all going a little overboard? I mean, we've faced the Horde before. What's the worst that could happen?

Adora: [quietly, seriously] You wanna know the worst that could happen? Fine. I'm the heaviest hitter, so Catra will separate me right away. Trap me, take my sword, do something so I'm helpless when she turns on you. She knows everything about me, exactly what I'll do, exactly how to take me out. [tosses her She-Ra figure face down onto the table; her voice grows in volume and emotional distress as she continues] They'll overwhelm Frosta and Mermista with bots [knocks over Mermista and Frosta's figures], they'll fire on Perfuma [knocks over Perfuma's plant] and use her to draw Bow out into the open, pinning him down between the bots and the Horde soldiers. Glimmer will teleport in to save him, but she won't have enough magic left to get out, trapping them both. [knocks over Bow's and Glimmer's figures] Catra will make me watch all of it before she finishes me off, and then everyone is gone, and the Horde wins the war, and Etheria crumbles, and it's all my fault! [knocks all the figures off the table]

[Adora puts her hands to her head]

Adora: The Horde nearly destroyed Etheria. We were barely able to stop it. If this plan isn't perfect...[breathes out in exasperation] if I'm not perfect...everyone will--[Adora pauses, then sighs]

Glimmer: Adora...I was captured by Shadow Weaver, taken to the Fright Zone, and lost my powers.

Bow: [whispers, hand raised to his mouth] Glimmer, not helping...

Glimmer: But you know what? We escaped. I fought without my powers...and we won! Bad things are going to happen. That's life. You can let it paralyze you...or you can roll with it. Figure out the things you can...and, trust that your friends have your back for the rest.

Bow: You've got this Adora.

Perfuma: I cast friendship and support on my next turn.

Mermista: Here. [metal shings as she lifts up the Trident into frame] This is my Trident of Power. I want you to have it, especially since Bow is making me a new one.

Bow: I didn't agree to that!

Mermista: You will.

Frosta: The Winter's Bane stands with you! Also--me--Frosta--stands with you--I--can't tell if we're still in character, or not...[slight chuckle]

Adora: [softly, happily] Thank you.

Bow: So...What do we do now?

Adora: [more enthusiastically; happily] We do what we do best: we improvise. [unsheathes her sword] ...For the Honor of Grayskull!

[She-Ra Transformation]

She-Ra: [looks at all her friends; determined] Let's go.


[Horde outpost]

[Horde flag flaps in the wind]

Lonnie: We've added more bots to the tower's weak points. Kyle is...hiding somewhere, and Rogelio is commanding the extra turrets.

Scorpia: [rushes to embrace Lonnie; nervously] A-And if there are plant monsters or warriors in ice armor or Sea-Ra--

Lonnie: [groans, coming out from under Scorpia's arm and placing her hand on her shoulder] For the last time, none of that stuff was real. [reassuringly] We've reinforced our defenses. We got this.

Scorpia: [sighs in relief] Okay. Good. Thanks, Lonnie. ...Who's Rogelio?

Lonnie: [incredulous] Rogelio... The lizard guy...

Scorpia: Oh, right. [Lonnie facepalms] Yeah, I wondered what his deal was...

[Both Scorpia and Lonnie gasp as a tremendous thud sounds nearby, along with a roaring sound]

Lonnie: [in disbelief] No...No, it can't be! [Kyle runs past, shouting in fear]

[The Plant Golem's hands spew vine magic down the wall and out to chase soldiers as it pulls its head over the wall as Perfuma rides it]

Perfuma: [chuckles slightly; announces happily] For the She-Ra! [The Plant Golem roars in response]

Scorpia: [stammers, shouting] F-f-fire!

[The turrets blast beams at the golem and Perfuma grunts; the turrets get blasted with a wave of ice magic]

Perfuma: Yay, Frosta!

Frosta: [hands, feet, and chest covered in ice, lands on the outer wall; slightly rueful] This is...colder than I thought it would be. [determined] But not a problem. [Bots march towards Frosta and she runs at them, hitting them with her fists as she passes] Snow...strike!

[The bots are pushed off the wall until Frosta sees the last one, punches her hand in preparedness, and then finishes it, grunting; she notices her ice on that hand is missing and makes a new gauntlet from the water that flows down to it]

Frosta: Thanks, Mermista.

Mermista: [standing atop a water spout, dressed in a rag-tag Sea-Ra outfit] You mean Sea-Ra, Princess of the Oceans! [a large wave crashes into the outpost wall, causing the turrets to spark]

[Arrows hit the turrets and they explode; Bow grunts as he jumps down; Glimmer teleports next to him and the rest of the crew]

[They all shout at relatively the same time after She-Ra]

She-Ra: [shouts] Charge!

Mermista: I am Sea-Ra!

Perfuma: [shouts] Plant magic!

Frosta: [shouts] The Winter's Bane!

[Horde soldiers scream and run away past Lonnie who gasps at the incoming wave of water; she shouts and grunts as she's carried away; She-Ra runs on the upper wall]

She-Ra: It's over, Catra. You've lost.

Scorpia: Catra's not here. But I'm happy to take you down for her. [shouts as she charges]

[Glimmer grunts as she throws a soldier back; she swats another with her staff, then teleports behind another to kick them; Kyle shouts as he runs at Glimmer with a charged stun baton; a net flies around him and grunts on the ground]

Bow: [standing nearby; laughs] Whoo! Yeah, gotcha! [a turret charges behind him]

Glimmer: Bow! [teleports to him and pushes him out of the way as the blast hits where they were standing, grunting as they hit the ground]

[Glimmer teleports behind Rogelio (manning the turret) and teleports him mid-air over the pass's river, at which he falls squealing and she teleports away; she pants with fatigue as she sees She-Ra fighting Scorpia on the other wall, grunting and shouting; she grunts as she teleports over]

She-Ra: [grunts as her sword and Scorpia's claw strain against one another] Catra's really not here? ...And she left you in charge?

Scorpia: [the sword and claw spark and scrape; annoyed] Yes! Why do people keep acting surprised about that?

[Scorpia pushes She-Ra back and She-Ra swings at her head and misses; She-Ra slides her foot back and drives the sword down, but Scorpia catches her arm in her claw with a metallic clang as her claw hits the gauntlet; She-Ra grunts as the sword is twisted out of her hand, then yelps as she is thrown by Scorpia on her back; Scorpia grunts as a burst of glitter magic hits the back of her head, at which she turns and gasps lightly; Glimmer shouts as she charges and swats at Scorpia, clanging the staff against her tail; Scorpia's tail encircles the staff and Glimmer screams as she is disarmed and spun to the ground; Glimmer gasps lightly as she is drug and then hung by one claw over the edge of the cliff; She-Ra sits up and gasps in alarm]

Scorpia: Bup, bup, bup! You stay where you are. Or we'll find out if Sparkles here has enough magic to land on her feet. [Glimmer groans in effort as she struggles] Like I was saying, Catra trusts--[Glimmer grunts and punches Scorpia's cheek, at which Scorpia grunts]--OW! Hey! [Glimmer continues to grunt and struggle, making swipes and kicks at Scorpia] You don't hit the person dangling you over the edge! Stop! [Glimmer shouts as she sends glitter magic into Scorpia's face; Scorpia yells in pain, then grunts, throwing Glimmer at She-Ra, who catches her]

She-Ra: [concerned] Glimmer? Are you okay?

Glimmer: [tired] How's that for improvising? [quickly, nervously] Also, it's your turn now because I'm completely out of magic.

Scorpia: [steps forward; angrily] Catra trusts--! [grunts as she's hit in the face with a jet of water] Catra--![shouts as plant magic hits her] Catra trusts--huh?! [gasps as she dodges an arrow] [incredulous] Okay, seriously? How many of you are there? [turns to see the rest of the Alliance behind her] Ohhh. ...Too many. ...Whoa! [shouts as she is thrown off the side of the wall]

[Scorpia splashes into the river below where Lonnie, Kyle, and Rogelio wait in a skiff on the shore; she grunts as she surfaces; the Horde flag comes down in a flourish and the Alliance cheers on top of the wall]

Bow: [shouts happily] That. Was. Awesome!

Glimmer: [elbows She-Ra] Good planning session.

She-Ra: [hugs Glimmer and Bow to her sides; softly] Thanks, guys.

[on the skiff, floating down the river]

Scorpia: [raises her claw] All in favor of blaming this on Kyle?

[At the same time:

Lonnie: Oh, yeah.

Rogelio: [growls in agreement]

Scorpia: Yep. Yeah, that's unanimous. ]

Kyle: [gasps in alarm; accepting, diappointment] Oh, man.
