Hordak: Finally.

Hordak:  Useless.



Imp: Useless.

Adora: I still can't believe Entrapta's working for the Horde. Shadow Weaver messed with her mind. She must have. Right?

Glimmer: I don't know. She seemed normal when we talked to her. Entrapta-normal, but still, she wants to be with the Horde. They do have better tech than us. But we have magic on our side.

Bow: Magic and tech aren't totally separate things. Entrapta is one of the only people who really understands that. She got closer to combining them than anyone else. And...now she's with the Horde.


Bow: Well, who needs Entrapta? You've got Bow, tech master and premier member of the Etherian Maker Community.

Bow: Ah.  Yeah, uh, meant to do that.

Swift Wind: Ahoy! Ha ha, be there in a sec.

Swift Wind: Comrades! I spotted buildings ahead, the outpost is close.


Glimmer: Entrapta made her decision. We can't change that. But we can focus on our mission and help all our people. We lost all contact with the farming outpost of Alwyn a week ago. The Horde hasn't been reported in the area, but we can't be too careful.

Adora:  They're definitely involved. They always are.

Glimmer: We can handle the Horde. I don't care if they do have Entrapta's inventions, they're no match for us! We'll handle this the way we always do.

Adora: Brute Strength?

Swift Wind: Almost dying?

Glimmer: No—and no! By sticking together, and never giving up.

Bow: Yeah! Best Friend Quad to the rescue!



Bow: Because there's four of us?


Bow: Okay, taking that one off the list.



Entrapta: Hm.

Entrapta: Emily, hand me a six sided hex driver.

Entrapta: You're right, Emily, how can we possibly work like this?


Catra: Uh, hello? Lord Hordak?


Hordak: State your purpose, Force Captain Catra.

Catra: Lord Hordak, I just thought we should, uh, you know, touch base, like you used to with Shadow Weaver. Figured we could establish a daily check-in—

Hordak: So, I'm to understand you've disturbed me for no reason.


Catra: Uh, not for no reason. We need to plan our next move against the Rebellion. The Horde's in a better spot than ever—

Hordak: Was squandering our advantage while the Whispering Woods regrew part of your plan?


Hordak: Was letting yourself get captured? Etheria's atmosphere has proven to be a complicating variable in my experiments.


Catra: I—(coughing)

Hordak: I just removed that variable. Tell me, Force Captain, how is your breathing?


Hordak: Pathetic. Just like everything on this backwards planet. Do you know what the definition of failure is, Force Captain?

Hordak: Failure is when something ceases to serve a purpose. When that happens, it becomes worthless to me. Thus far, your performance has been lacking.

Catra: I haven't failed yet. No one knows how to take the princesses down better than me. Trust me, and let me do that.


Hordak: You say you can defeat the Rebellion?


Hordak: Prove it. You are dismissed.


Imp: Pathetic. Pathetic. Pathetic.


Swift Wind: Uh, hello? I thought you should know, I'm sensing something weird the closer we get to the outpost.

Adora: Weird? Like what?

Swift Wind: I can't describe it, just...weird. What is this place?

Glimmer: Alwyn is the Rebellion's biggest supplier of—uh, well, supplies. It's basically one big orchard. One big, happy—incredibly creepy orchard.


Swift Wind:  What? Creepy apples taste as good as normal apples.

Glimmer: The outpost must be up ahead.


Adora: I don't see any Horde soldiers. I actually don't see anyone. Where are they?

Glimmer: Maybe they're all inside?

Bow: Let me take a look. I've upgraded my tracker pad to detect Horde signals. If they're here, we'll find them with this.


Bow: Oh, man. I must've broken something during the upgrade. Not to worry, I can fix this.


Bow: I don't know how to fix this.

Glimmer: It's okay! Whatever's going on here, we'll solve it. Nothing gets past us!


Glimmer: Even if people used to tell stories about Alwyn being haunted.

Adora: Haunted? Like with ghosts?

Glimmer:  It's just stories. And even if it wasn't, we'd handle them. No reason to be scared.

Adora: Huh. Well, Shadow Weaver used to tell me about ghosts when I was a kid in the Horde. Like the story of the Weeping Princess, a vengeful spirit who roams Etheria looking for victims. You know she's coming for you by the sound of weeping right before she strikes.

Swift Wind:  What was that?


Glimmer: What?

Swift Wind: I'm not sure, I thought I heard someone. A voice.

Adora:  The Weeping Princess?

Swift Wind: No. Someone's here, I'm sure of it. We have to find them.


Catra: Third Battalion is closest. If they move on Erlandia, the Rebellion will have to answer.

Scorpia: Uh, yeah, small problem? Um, the Third Battalion is refusing to fight because they don't have armor. They've put in...where is it...um, six requests for resupply. Didn't you see these?

Catra: I've been a little busy, you know, almost toppling Bright Moon and coming closer than anyone ever has to conquering the planet for the Horde? Not that anyone seems to care.

Scorpia: I care.

Catra: Fine. Give them the armor.

Scorpia: Ah. Okay, um...boy, I'd sure like to do that, uh...but the armory is out of armor.

Catra: So have them make more.

Scorpia: Okay, just gotta find that file.


Scorpia: They're just, they're so slidey, and slippery.

Catra: How am I supposed to defeat the Rebellion when all I do is this stupid busy work? I bet Shadow Weaver didn't have to deal with any of this.

Scorpia: Uh, these are her files, so, she probably did? Just saying, that's—that's a guess on my part.


Entrapta: Hi.

Catra: You're not a prisoner anymore. You don't have to sneak around.

Entrapta: The ducts are faster, and I don't have time to waste. I need a six-sided hex driver right now.

Catra: I'm the one who doesn't have time to waste. Aren't you some kind of genius? Make do with what you have.

Entrapta: (Groans) Of course I could, but it's the principle. Always use the proper tool for the job. If you can't help me, it's fine, I saw one in Hordak's lab.


Catra: I know you're new to the Fright Zone, and possibly to being around people in general, but Hordak isn't somebody to mess with. Under no circumstances will you go anywhere near Hordak's sanctum.

Entrapta: Ooh. He calls his lab a sanctum. Oh, that is so classy!

Catra: Focus! I need you to promise that you will stay away from Hordak. Promise!

Entrapta: Okay, okay! I promise.

Scorpia: Catra!  Here it is! Oh, okay, so the armory can't make more armor because they are...out of irid—do-iridul-lum? Irideli—the point is, they're out of the shiny stuff they need to make armor.

Catra: So where do we get more?

Scorpia: Oh, uh, I don't have a file for that.


Catra: I'll handle it myself. But keep and eye on Entrapta, and make sure she doesn't go anywhere near Hordak.

Scorpia: Got it, boss. I won't let her out of my sight. Now, you didn't happen to see which way she went, did you?


Scorpia: You know what? I'll figure it out. I'll figure it out. (Laughs)


Bow, Glimmer, Adora, and Swift wind wander into the village, looking in different directions, wary.

Adora: Hello?

Swift Wind:  Ahh!  Uh, uh, I mean . . . whooo did that?  Bow-man, tch, you gotta pull yourself together!


Swift Wind: I’ll wait out here in case anyone tries to sneak up on you.  Also, this door is too small for horses, which is rude.

Glimmer:  Okay.  On three.  One, two, THREE!!

Adora: The food is cold.  Whoever lives here left in a hurry, but it was . . . a while ago.

Bow: There’s no sign of the Horde.  There’s no sign of a struggle at all.  They just . . . left.

Adora: This is just like the story of the Headless Princess.  She stalks the night, pulling people out of their beds, leaving nothing but bloody footprints!  [gasp]


Swift Wind:  Whaddya find!!!

Swift Wind: Sorry.  I . . . don’t like being out here by myself.

Glimmer:  We should check out the other buildings.

Bow: Hey, Guys!

Adora: Sorry.  What did you say?


Bow: Does that look familiar to you.

Adora: I’m not sure.  Maybe it’s . . .

Adora: Huh . . . Uhhhhh, Glimmer?

Glimmer: [smiling, sheepishly] I’m so sorry.  I have no idea why I did that.

Adora:  Ah, this place is weird.  Like the Lair of the Undead Princess!  Where she lures soldiers to their doom!

Bow: Undead princess?  The Horde really had a theme, huh?

Adora: Oh . . . You’re right!  Wow.  I can’t believe I’m just realizing this now.

Glimmer: Weird or not, we have a mission.  Something happened here that forced these people to flee their home.  We have to get to the bottom of this.



Entrapta:  Ethical dilemma number . . . ahhhhhhhhhhh . . . sixty-three.  I told Catra I wouldn’t go into Hordak’s lab.  But, if she never finds out, does it count?  I could just pop in, grab the tool, and then pop out.  No one would ever know.  But, I would know.  Ahhhh, I shouldn’t do it.  Or should I?  Nooo, I shouldn’t.


Entrapta:  A six-sided hex driver!


Entrapta: This is amazing!!


Entrapta: Ohhh . . .


Entrapta: Well, there’s no reason to get huffy because an experiment fails.  Failure is a vital part of scientific endeavor.


Entrapta: What if I have given up on you after the first explosion?  Or the fiftieth?!  I know, I should leave.  But I have to stay, for science!!!


Glimmer: Huh?  Hmmm.


Glimmer: It’s totally abandoned.

Adora: Do you guys hear that?

Swift Wind:  Yes!  Finally!  I told you.  It’s a weird sound.

Adora:  It’s like something . . . someone is singing!

Glimmer: I don’t hear anything.  It’s probably just the wind.

Bow: Okay.  I’m hearing something, too.


Adora:  There!  Something’s there!  [drawing the sword] For the Honor of Grayskull!

Glimmer: Wait!

Bow: Adora!

Entrapta:  Hello.  You’re blocking my light.  If you could just step aside . . .

Hordak:  Get!  OUT!!!

Entrapta:  Well, just a sec.  I’m almost finished.

Entrapta:  Okay.  All done.  Byyyee!

Hordak scowls as she begins to walk away.

Hordak: There will be dire consequences for this flagrant breach of conduct.


Entrapta:  You were using uninsulated cables.  I, uh, replaced themf or you.  Try it again.  It should hold the charge, now.

Hordak: She was . . . right.

Entrapta: Of course I was right!


Entrapta: It’s beautiful!  It’s a power source, isn’t it?  What are you building that needs so much power?

Hordak struggles for a reply, but she is already across the room, studying the displays.

Entrapta: I recognize these formulas.  You’re experimenting with portals?  But that’s . . . I mean, I’m familiar with the concept, but multi-dimensional gates are purely theoretical.  No one’s every come close to actually achieving one.  Right?

Hordak: Obviously, someone from a backwater planet such as yours couldn’t possibly comprehend it.

Entrapta: Hey!  All right.  I’m the one who got your power source working, so . . . tell me everything!!

Hordak: Portals aren’t theoretical.  They’re real.  And I’m going to open one.

Entrapta:  You are?!  Ahhhhh.  Can I help you?!!  Ah, just think of the possibilities!  You could . . . transport troops, and, and weapons . . . whatever you need from one side of the planet to the other!

Hordak: You think too small.  Unsurprising.  You can’t begin to understand the potential a device of this nature will possess.

Entrapta:  Wait!  If Etheria is a backwater planet, does that mean there are others?

Hordak: Of course.  There are countless galaxies filled with countless other worlds.  Etheria is the only planet I’ve ever encountered that does not seem to understand that.

Entrapta:  Other planets?  And you’ve . . . been there?

Catra:  I’ve contacted every mine under Horde control, but none of them have the material to make more armor, and without the armor, I can’t attack Erlandia.  You’re trying to sabotage me!!  Where’s the missing file?!!

Shadow Weaver: The material you seek comes from the foundry.  Right her in the Fright Zone.

Catra:  Fine.

Shadow Weaver: Being me isn’t quite what you imagined, is it?  I suppose you thought Hordak would let you . . . run things now.

Catra: He does.  I can do what I want.

Shadow Weaver: But he’ll never trust you with his real plans.  Don’t take it personally.  He never did with me, either.

Catra: I don’t know what you’re talking about.  Maybe Hordak didn’t trust you, but he trusts me plenty.


Bow: Ooahh!

She-Ra: The light came from around hear.

Bow: There!  It’s over . . . !


She-Ra:  Where’d it go?  Did I get it?

Glimmer No!   RUN!!!

Glimmer: Ahhh!  Run the other way!!

Swift Wind: She-Ra, do something!

She-Ra: Like what?!!  Flail at them again?!!  I can handle the Horde.  I can’t handle this!  This is like what . . .

Glimmer: [cutting her off] Stop telling ghost stories!!  I’ve been terrified since we got here!!!  Catra was right!  I’m terrible at this!

Bow: And I can’t replace Entrapta!  I can’t even make my tracker pad work!

Swift Wind: I’m still hearing stuff coming from the big stone pointy thing!

Bow: From the pointy . . .   Hold on.


Glimmer: What are you doing?!  Bow!


Bow:  Of course.  This place.  It’s a First One’s ruin.  And these aren’t ghosts.  They’re holograms!

She-Ra:  I’m pretty sure holograms can’t walk around on their own like this.

Bow: But, look at them.  Really look at them.

Glimmer: No thanks!  I’m good!

She-Ra:  It’s . . . it’s like a recording.

Glimmer: Ahhhh.  She’s waving!

Glimmer waves back, smiling.  Then after a moment.

Glimmer: Actually, you know what?  It’s still creepy.

Bow: I think I know where they’re coming from.  Come on!


Scorpia: Catra!  Catra!  Hey, Catra!



Scorpia: Oh, wow.  You are fast.  Anyway, I found the file, and guess what.

Catra: The material is produced right here in the Fright Zone?

Scorpia:  Beautiful and brilliant.

Catra:  Where’s Entrapta?!  You’re supposed to be watching her!

Scorpia:  You know, she is, she’s, she’s . . . I don’t know where she is, truthfully, but I’m gonna fix that because that’s just the kind of friend I am.  You’re welcome.



Entrapta: This is probably the max with what you’ve got to work with here.  If we had some First One’s tech, we could generate even more voltage.


Catra:  I’m sorry, Lord Hordak.  Entrapta is still new here.  I, I, I, I promise, she will never bother you again.

Hordak:  You are the one bothering me, Force Captain . . . with your unwelcome intrusion!  I.  Am.  Working.  With Entrapta’s assistance.

Entrapta:  Did you hear that, Emily?  I’ve never had a lab partner before!

Swift Wind:  This is it!  The noise is coming from here!

She-Ra:  It looks like Light Hope’s beacon.

Bow: It’s an antenna.  I’m guessing this outpost is built on some kind of First Ones communication hub.  When the Black Garnet disrupted the planet, it must have caused the hub to power up.  It’s trying to send old stored messages.  With you translating, we should be able to turn it off.

She-Ra:  So . . . these are First Ones?

Bow:  Yeah.  Why?

She-Ra:  It’s just . . . I’ve been thinking of them as these big epic figures.  But they’re regular people, . . . sending messages to their loved ones.  Messages that were never received because of what Mara did to the planet.

She-Ra: Be at rest, now.

Bow: The farmers must have fled from the “ghosts” when this thing turned itself on.  We should be able to get them a message that it’s safe to return.

Glimmer:  Way to go!  I think the Rebellion is going to do just fine with you, Master-maker Bow!

Bow:  Thanks, Glimmer!  Now that the antenna is powered down, everything should be back to normal.

Bow: It’s that message again.  It looks like First Ones writing.

Swift Wind: Huh.  But we powered down the antenna.

She-Ra:  Well, if it is First Ones writing, I can’t read it.  It’s way too degraded.

Glimmer: You said it yourself, Bow.  Your pad must be broken.

Bow: Yeah . . . that must be it.
