Adora: [quickly running and leaping, spinning and crashing her staff down on a drone as they scatter; shouting] For Etheria! [the drone begins to fly away, but Adora spins her staff again and impales it, making it buzz with electricity]

[The two Etherian civilians sigh in relief, then cry out in fear as another drone flies toward them; an arrow pierces and knocks down the drone]

Bow: [leaping in and landing next to Adora; confidently] Two down.

[A third drone flies upward and away before Swift Wind kicks it with a grunt, knocking it down]

Swift Wind: And a whole Galactic Horde to go.

[The drone falls and Perfuma grabs it with a vine as Frosta punches it with an ice fist, both grunting]

Mermista: [standing next to Frosta] I'll get the next one, I guess.

[Adora pulls her staff out of the first drone with a metal shing as Swift Wind lands next to the crew]

Adora: [to the Etherian civilians] It's okay, you can come out now.

[Several civilians come out of the woods to cross a river, whilst protected by the princesses, Swift Wind, and Bow; Adora looks up at a control spire just before a laser blast fires past, causing the civilians to scream]

Adora: [shouting] Run!

[A tree explodes nearby as Horde bots run toward the group; as the last of the civilians run across, Frosta gasps to follow them, Perfuma removes her vine bridge, Swift Wind neighs, and everyone except Mermista and Adora stay with the civilians]

Mermista: [quietly, confidently] My turn. [shouts with effort, throwing a huge wave of water from the river at the bots, pushing them all away except one which gets pinned against a tree]

Bow: [calling out] Come on, let's go before they-- [Adora gives a prolonged shout, running at the bot; reprimanding] --Adora!

[Adora shouts again as she leaps at the bot, grunting as she dodges its swipes; metal clangs as Adora's staff connects with the bot's arm; the bots laser arm charges and fires, Adora barely avoiding the blast and gasping; they continue to fight until Adora jabs the bot in the laser arm and electricity buzzes along its exterior until it explodes; more bots and drones rush in]

Adora: [raising her staff, shouting] For the honor of-- [looking at her staff, cutting herself off; tone falters, prolonged] Ooooh...

[Adora gasps as she barely dodges a laser blast; a bot runs in and clamps its arms onto her staff, metal clanging; Adora grunts as she is lifted into the air by the staff, then thrown into a tree]

Bow: [firing an arrow into a drone making it explode; calling out in concern] Adora!

Adora: [holding her side, slowly getting up; quickly] I'm okay! I'm okay--ow! [collapses back into the tree holding her side]

Mermista: [running up to put her hands on Adora's shoulders; reprimanding] Adora, chill. [quietly, with empathy] You're not...She-Ra anymore, remember?

Adora: [as another bot runs past; trilling with effort] I'm on it!

Mermista: [groaning] Ugh, I just said...

Adora: Gotcha!

Horde Prime: [sitting in his throne] Well... Who are you?

Adora: [panting and walking around; quietly, wondering] ...What is this?


Adora: [holding out her hand] What...?
