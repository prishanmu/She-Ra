Darla's Interface: Alert. We are being pulled in by an outside force.

[Darla is pulled in to Horde Prime's ship, where it lands with a thump; an energy barrier thrums closed behind Darla; Darla's hatch whooshes open and a ramp thuds when connected to the ground; Adora surrenders and walks slowly toward the clones, then grunts as they grab her; clones walk into Darla]

Adora: You won't find anything; I came alone. I hear Horde Prime's been looking for me. Figured it was time we met.

[The two clones on Darla walk back up empty handed]

Clone: [smugly] Yes. You will be brought before Prime. And there you will receive your judgement.

[Adora grunts when the clones holding her push her forward; they walk away, just as Entrapta, Bow, and Glimmer fall out of the back of Darla, grunting when they hit the ground]

Entrapta: Spacesuit testing officially a success. All suits stood up to ship's velocity [pulls at suit with hair, causing it to snap back elastically] with zero loss of life.

Glimmer: [nervously] Wait, what? That was a possibility?

Bow: [tapping an in-ear radio that beeps] We're in. [over the radio while scene transitions to Adora's perspective] They didn't find us.

Adora: [whispering; serious] Good. Be quick, and don't get caught.

[Opening theme]


[Hallway, Horde Prime's ship]

[Glimmer breathes softly as she peers around a corner]

Glimmer: [presses her radio and it beeps; softly] Okay, everyone, sound off. I'm heading to Horde Prime's holding cell to get Catra.

[scene transitions to Bow and Entrapta in a different hallway]

Bow: [radio beeps as he taps it; low voice] And Entrapta and I are going to hack into the ship's server and download any intel about Prime's weak points.

[Scene transition back to Glimmer]

Glimmer: [radio beeps] Look for a room with a lot of glowing tech in it. I remember them taking me past it when--when they took me to... That has to be the server.

Entrapta: [whispers] Then that's our access point! Although, as long as we're here, you wouldn't mind if I just took a few readings--[grunts as Bow grabs her arm before she walks away; as she's being dragged by Bow in the opposite direction, pointing with her hair]--okay. To the server room!

[Scene transition to Adora being escorted by clones in a different hallway]

Adora: [whispers] Okay, uh--everyone, just be careful.

[Clones standing beside a large energy field doorway palm it, causing it to hum as it ripples open]

Clone: [stepping aside from in front of Adora] You will go alone.

Bow, over the radio: [radio beeps] You've got this, Adora. Keep him talking.

Glimmer, over the radio: [scoffs] Knowing him, that is not going to be a problem.

[Adora breathes out as she begins to walk over a singular platform; the room's ambiance is a constant low humming of voices in a choir; Adora steps to Prime's throne]

Adora: Prime.

[A clone steps aside to reveal Prime sitting and in-taking a green fluid through tubes which gurgles]

Horde Prime: Welcome...Adora.


[Hallway, Horde Prime's ship]

[Glimmer walks into an intersection of halls; she sighs anxiously, then continues to walk, huffing and panting increasingly nervously, starting to hyperventilate]

Bow, over the radio: [radio beeps] Hey. [Glimmer gasps in fear] You okay?

Glimmer: [sighs in relief; beeps her radio] What?

[scene transition to Bow and Entrapta in a different hallway]

Glimmer, over the radio: You worried about me?

Bow: Maybe. Just...

[Scene transition back to Glimmer]

Bow, over the radio: ...Be careful, okay?

Glimmer: [fondly] Yeah.

[Scene transition back to Bow and Entrapta]

Glimmer, over the radio: You too.

Entrapta: [tablet she's holding beeps] Still no sign of the server room... [gestures with her hair] This place is so big...and empty. [incredulously] Where are the vents? How does anyone get around in this place?

[Two clones begin to walk around the corner]

Bow: [radio beeps; with urgency] Call you right back, gotta go.[grabs and pulls on Entrapta, who grunts]

[Both run and pant, before Bow cuts around a different corner and yanks Entrapta, grunting, with him; they peer around the corner as the two clones approach, causing Bow to gasp and cover Entrapta's mouth as she grunts; Entrapta hums a squeak when she spots a glowing entrance-way]

Entrapta: [muffled grunt; then, when she removes Bow's hand, whispers] That must be the server room.

[She lifts them both on her hair and walks them toward the room; she drops Bow, who thuds on the floor and grunts; Bow gasps at the sight of two clones and many more encased in hollow, egg-shaped pods filled with a green liquid, as Entrapta whimpers in excitement, echoing]

Bow: [calling out] Uh...Hello. Would you believe that we're the...[voice cracks] inspectors?

[One clone closes the door behind them in a hum, and then both snarl as they charge at Bow and Entrapta; Entrapta and Bow scream as Bow readies an arrow]


[Horde Prime's throne room]

[over the radio, Entrapta's scream is cut out by transmission buzzing]

Horde Prime: Forgive my unseemly state. It is a tedious task, [chair hisses as it spins to let Horde Prime face Adora] but a necessary one to maintain this vessel.

Adora: [clenches fist; sternly] This is how it's going to go. We're gonna make a deal. You're gonna give me Catra, and then you're gonna let me leave again, free and clear. I have something you want. A weapon that [places hand on her chest] only She-Ra can activate: The Heart of Etheria. And if you don't do what I say, then I'll use it...and destroy you and your empire for good.

[A fluid tube squirts and drips as a clone detaches it from Horde Prime; Horde Prime's eyes squelch as he looks at Adora with all four eyes; he then laughs long as the monitors behind him hum high-pitched]

Adora: [clears her throat; beginning to be annoyed] Is...is something funny?

Horde Prime: [amused] You are not going to use the weapon, or you would have already done so. You would never risk the safety of your Catra.

Adora: [quietly, angrily] You don't know me. And you don't know what I'm capable of.

Horde Prime: [seething] Oh...but I do.

[A hum whirs powering-down as the clones detach the tubes from Horde Prime's neck; more tubes pull free and hiss with steam]

Horde Prime: [as his 'hair' tubes reconnect themselves and the clones do something behind his back] I am old, far older than you can imagine. My brothers lend me their life force, and when [palms the side of one of the clones' faces] one vessel fails me, I simply elect another. [pets the clone] Thus, Prime has reigned eternal through the centuries. There is something so...[walks toward Adora]...familiar about you, Adora. [Adora gasps as he grabs her chin] A face I have not seen in a thousand years. [Adora grunts as she shakes her face from his grasp] Not since I faced your ancestors, and crushed their once-mighty empire beneath my heel. You call them the First Ones. And you are one of them, [Adora gasps softly] are you not, Adora?


Bow: Whoa!

[A clone grunts as Bow snares him with a net arrow, then he grunts when he jumps and fires an explosive arrow at the other clone who charges and shouts; Entrapta whimpers and runs to the energy door]

Entrapta: [placing her hand on the door, it beeps negatively] Oh, come on, baby, come on!

[Entrapta glances back to see another clone in an open pod as Bow and the other clone fight, grunting]

Entrapta: [softly] Hordak? [walks toward the clone]

[Bow fires an arrow whistling at the other clone, who grunts as he is covered in goo and splashes into a pool of green liquid in the center of the room; Bow pauses before he looks at Entrapta]

Bow: [shouts] Entrapta, no! What are you doing?!

Entrapta: [sadly] Hordak... [holds up the First Ones tech she gave to Hordak for his suit] That's you, isn't it? I...brought it for you. [hopefully] I thought you might need it, do you recognize it? [softly] Do you....recognize me?

[The clone is silent, then grunts, teeth clenched, and Entrapta whimpers; the clone shouts angrily and grabs Entrapta's hair, causing her to scream; the clone extends to far, causing the cables attached to him to detach and zap with electricity as Entrapta grunts in distress]

Clone: You are trespassing, Prime shall hear of this, and his punishment shall be merciless, for Prime sees all--[elongated shakily as he is shot by an electric arrow, electricity zapping around him; the explosion at the end of this knocks him back, landing in a thud and grunt]

Bow: [running to him] No, no! [Clone whimpers in pain and falls forward onto Bow] Stay in there! [his remaining cables snap off as electricity crackles, finally falling on top of Bow as he shouts; they thud on the ground, Bow grunting]

Entrapta: [as the clone whimpers] Well that's definitely not Hordak, so we can cross that one off our list.

Bow: [annoyed] I wasn't aware that we had a list!

Clone: [gasps, getting off Bow] Where...am I? I cannot connect to the hive-mind. I am...alone? [begins to sob] I am alone...

Entrapta: [the clone sobs loudly and Bow shushes him] Uh-oh... We broke him.

Clone: [Bow pushes him back up into his pod; sobbing] Horde Prime. How will he see my thoughts? How will he know that I am faithful?

Bow: [clone continues sobbing haltingly] It's all right. We'll, uh...we'll tell him. [clones sniffs] O-okay, buddy?

Clone: You...you will tell him? [snot drips]

Bow: [unsure] Uh...sure?

Clone: [Bow runs away crying out as the clone leans forward almost falling again] You...know Horde Prime?

[Bow runs and grabs Entrapta's hand, she grunts as she's yanked up and running; Bow pants as they run, then grunts as he bumps into the clone]

Clone: [imploringly] Please...let me accompany you and prove myself worthy to Horde Prime.

Bow: No, that's--that's really okay, uh--

Entrapta: Can you open this door?

[The clone places his hand on the energy door and it opens in a hum; Entrapta places her hands together and happily squeals slightly]

Bow: [sternly] We're not keeping him.

Entrapta: [pleadingly] But we broke him! We're responsible for him now. [trills] Plus, he can open doors...

Bow: Can you...take us to the server room?

Clone: [happily] I would be honored to serve one who is a beloved of Horde Prime.

Bow: [sighs deeply] All right, then, Wrong Hordak. Lead the way.

[Wrong Hordak groans, and falls into Bow, pointing]

Bow: Or...point and...I'll just keep dragging you. That's fine, too. [they all walk out]


[Hallway, Horde Prime's ship]

[Glimmer places her hand on an energy door, and she gasps when it reveals the empty containment cell]

Glimmer: [radio beeps; voice shaking nervously] Guys, I found the cell, but...Catra's not here. What do we do?

[Radio shrieks and buzzes with static]

Glimmer: [growing more frantic] Bow? Entrapta? ...Adora?!

[scene transition to Horde Prime's throne room]

Horde Prime: I thought the First Ones were all gone, but clearly...some faction remains. That race of tyrants...abandoned you on a forgotten planet in a shadow dimension. They made you their weapon, their...She-Ra.

Adora: [angrily] I don't fight for the First Ones. I fight for my home, for myself, and for my friends. Now for the last time: where is Catra?

Catra, off-screen: [fearfully] Adora?

Adora: [concerned, calling out] Catra? Where are you?

Horde Prime: Of course. Your Catra. She hoped you would come for her...poor thing. So all I had to was wait. As she would've said, "You are so very predictable." [looking behind Adora] ...Come here, child.

[Two clones and a third figure step up the stairs behind Adora; the third figure slips back a hood to reveal a Chipped Catra, hair cut short and fully green eyes; Chipped Catra always speaks in an unnaturally blissful and passive way]

Chipped Catra: Hello, Adora.


[Hallway, Horde Prime's ship]

Bow: Come on, Wrong Hordak. Any clue where the server room is yet?

Wrong Hordak: Forgive me, brother. The ship is designed so that it may only be navigated by one who has access to the hive-mind. [starts to sob]...And I have been cut-off...

Entrapta: [tablet beeps; shouts] There's something in here! A big energy signal, this has to be it!

[Wrong Hordak's hand is used by Entrapta to open an energy door that hums disappearing; Bow gasps as they gaze at a room with a large spire; the door behind them closes with a hum]

Bow: [radio beeps and buzzes with static] Adora, we found it! [static continues] Adora...?

[scene transition to Horde Prime's throne room]

Adora: [shouts] What did you do to her?! [she tries to run for Catra, but two clones grab her and hold her back]

[Chipped Catra walks to the foot of the throne, getting on her knees and bowing]

Horde Prime: I have made her anew. I saw her mind...[reaches out for Catra's hand, and Chipped Catra takes it to stand]...so ensnared in grief and rage and pain...and I brought her to the light. Isn't that right...[thumbs at the chip on the back of her neck] little sister?

Adora: [shouts] Catra, you have to fight it!

Chipped Catra: My place is with Horde Prime, Adora. I don't want to leave.

Horde Prime: Tell her what I've done for you.

Chipped Catra: [walks to Adora] Prime has given me peace. Something you could never do. [palms the side of Adora's face] You broke my heart. But he has made it whole again. Don't you see? This is for the best. I'm happy here. [moves hand to Adora's shoulder, close to the back of her neck] You could be happy, too.

Adora: [angrily, to Horde Prime] Let her go.

[A whooshing, almost whispering of voices, happens, then Horde Prime places a hand on Catra's shoulder and she gasps]

Horde Prime: Shall we make a deal, Adora? [slowly] I will give her to you, if...you want her... But first, you must do something for me. You...will give me She-Ra.

Adora: [determined] Never.

Horde Prime: Very well. [snaps fingers]

[A high pitched hum, then electricity zaps, static buzzes, and a high-pitched feedback happens in Adora's in-ear radio; Adora grunts in pain, and Glimmer, Entrapta, and Bow cry out]

[Clones open the door to Bow and Entrapta in a hum; Glimmer grunts in pain and her radio clatters when she throws it; she notices clones approaching, so she opens the energy door behind her in a hum and gasps at Horde Prime's trophy room; she pants and runs in]

[Adora grunts in pain, her radio falling and clattering out of her ear, and Horde Prime smashes it with a crack]

Horde Prime: You miscalculated. [slowly] I see all. I know all. [normal pace] You thought yourself worthy to challenge me...but you are nothing but a false hero, the last of the First Ones to fall at my hands. You have led your friends to destruction. [at the last word, he tightens his grip on Catra's shoulder and she gasps, her eyes turning back to normal for a moment, breathing in sharply, then back to green]

[Adora gasps]

Horde Prime: [amused] Go on, fulfill your purpose.Bring out She-Ra, and strike me down.

[Adora breathes out heavily, almost sobbing]

Horde Prime: [amused] Ah...[pats Chipped Catra on the head, and she hums] but you two must have a lot of catching up to do. I will leave you to it. Let me know when you're ready to make a deal.

[Horde Prime and his clones walk away, an energy door hums open; Chipped Catra's fist clenches, then her claws elongate, making a shing noise]


[Horde Prime's trophy room]

[Clones search the room, walking about; Glimmer pants, hiding, then gasps when she spots a staff hanging on the wall; a clone grunts and thuds on the ground]

Glimmer: Hey. Remember me? [shouts and charges]

[Scene transition back to Horde Prime's throne room]

[Adora shouts in pain as Chipped Catra punches her; Adora dodges and attempts to restrain Catra/stop Catra from fighting her, kicking her away, grunting and shouting; Chipped Catra's claws shing as she tries to swipe, but Adora grabs her arm]

Adora: [restraining Catra by holding her arm; emotionally] Catra, listen to me. I know you're still in there. [enunciates] I'm not leaving without you.

[Chipped Catra strains at the hold, a sound like leather being stretched; Chipped Catra half-laughs]

Adora: It's gonna be okay--

[Chipped Catra's arm bones crack, twisting unnaturally in Adora's hold; Adora groans in pain and shouts as Chipped Catra uses her other hand to claw her leg, ripping the fabric]

Chipped Catra: [as she puts Adora into a tight hold, and Adora whimpers, pained] Everything is already okay. We are with Prime now. There is no need for you to suffer, [slightly caresses Adora's jaw with a claw, Adora hisses in a breath] Adora. Come into the light with me.

[Adora yells as she grabs Catra and throws her from behind herself, Catra half-somersaulting and slamming her chip against the dais of Horde Prime's throne, grunting; Chipped Catra laughs, almost maniacally]

Adora: [desperately] Snap out of it, Catra. I don't want to hurt you...

Chipped Catra: [finally finishes laughing with a sharp intake of air] ...But you have already hurt me. Prime has set me free of that pain. The pain that you caused. [steps up the stairs toward the throne] He will set us all free...forever. A world of peace, without end.

[Silence as Adora stares at Catra in horrified and sad disbelief; Chipped Catra then lunges at Adora, who dodges her punch, then punches back, connecting, grunting; Chipped Catra returns the punch and continues swiping at her while Adora grabs her arms, grunting with effort, and throws her backward toward the edge of the platform]

Adora: [reaches out, shouting in concern] Catra!

[Chipped Catra notices the ledge, then laughs, stepping backward; Adora gasps and shouts, lunging to grab her; Adora pants and hums in relief as she pulls Catra back and embraces her; Adora groans in pain as Chipped Catra rips the back of her jacket]

Horde Prime and Chipped Catra: [voices layered together] Oh, Adora... How long will you drag this out? You will destroy the ones you love in the process.

[Chipped Catra knees Adora in the stomach, Adora groans in pain; Chipped Catra grabs Adora's collar and holds her over the edge of the platform]


[Horde Prime's server room]

Entrapta: [as Bow fires net arrows and ensnares a clone, grunting and thudding to the floor; nervously] Horde Prime's server is infinitely more complex than anything I've ever encountered. [her tablet flashes and beeps negatively as it scans the network paths] It's like a neural network, branching off in every possible direction in a three-dimensional configuration.

Bow: [firing another arrow; nervously] What does that mean?

Entrapta: [shouting, frustrated] It means it's gonna take a lot longer to decipher than I thought!

Bow: We have to get out of here! [clone snarls as he grabs onto Bow's bow] Whoa!

Wrong Hordak: [grunting as he pushes and tosses the clones away from Entrapta] Brothers, why do you attack? We serve Horde Prime's will.

[Bow grunts as he thuds to the ground, then gasps at the clone pointing an arrow at him]

Clone: [triumphantly] Enemies of Horde Prime will know the terror of his--[grunts as he is thwacked by a staff from behind]

[Clone grunts as he hits the ground; Bow gasps lightly as he looks up]

Glimmer: [tapping the staff on her hand] I always hated that guy in particular. And also, all the other guys I hit on the way in.

Bow: [hugging onto her as she laughs; happily] Glimmer!

[Both laugh; Clones begin to get up from the floor and crawl toward them; Glimmer whimpers and they back away, then both scream as one closer to them gets up; the clone shouts angrily and Glimmer grunts, kicking him away]

Glimmer: [enunciating her words with effort while hitting the clone near them twice; growling nervously] We have to get out of here!

Entrapta: [typing makes beeping noises; exasperated] But I haven't finished yet!

Glimmer: There's no time. We might not be able to hack him, [determined] but we can still make him hurt.

[Glimmer yells as she runs for the console, stabbing her staff into it; the console zaps with electricity, sending sparking and crackling waves up the server tower]

Glimmer: Let's go!

[They all run out as several areas in the server room explode]


[Horde Prime's throne room]

[Pebbles scrape as Adora shuffles her feet to stay on the edge of the platform]

Horde Prime and Chipped Catra: [voices layered together] She was afraid, in the end. And she suffered. Perhaps I will make her my new vessel...though, she would not last me long. What do you think...[voices whisper and whoosh as Chipped Catra speaks by herself] Adora?

[Adora grabs onto Catra's arm and screams, pushing them back onto the platform; Adora slams Catra into the monitors with a glass-cracking noise, and Catra's chip sparks and crackles with electricity; Chipped Catra laughs hysterically, then voices whoosh and whisper as Catra's eyes return to normal for a moment; Catra gasps as the voices whoosh again and her eyes turn back to green; Adora gasps softly; a large tremor booms and the room shakes, rubble falling, causing the monitors to beep and glitch out]

Adora: [determined] I am not giving up on you, Catra!

Chipped Catra: [as the monitors beep in and out behind her] Then you're a fool. You cannot stop Horde Prime. [the monitors crackles with electricity] He will reign triumphant over all the universe. It is...destiny--[electricity zaps behind her at her chip, and Catra screams]

Adora: No! [drags Catra away from the monitors as they hum with a building energy, still crackling with electricity, until they shatter; the glass then explodes, pieces clattering, and Adora grunts as she runs and leaps with Catra to land nearby on the ground; Catra's chip crackles with electricity; Catra pants and grunts in pain, opening her eyes to see Adora, Adora gasping slightly]

Catra: [raggedly] Adora...you should have stayed away. Why did you come back? We both know I don't matter...

Adora: [cupping Catra's face; desperately] You matter to me.

[Catra smiles and half-sobs, then gasps as voices whoosh, her eyes turning back to green and pulling Adora's hand away; Chipped Catra slaps Adora, causing her to grunt; Catra walks toward the ledge, then cries out in pain as the chip sparks with electricity]

Adora: [desperately, voice shaking] Come on, Catra! You've never listened to anyone in your life! Are you really going to start now?!

[The chip sparks and voices whoosh as Catra's eyes turn back to normal]

Catra: [sadly, smiling] You're such an idiot...

Adora: [half-sobs, half-laughs] Yeah...I know...

[Catra laughs, then the voices whoosh as she hugs herself]

Adora: I'm going to take you home.

Catra: [voices whoosh as her eyes turn back to normal; half-sobs; weakly] ...Promise?

Adora: [reaching out her hand; desperately] I promise!

Catra: [shakily] ...Adora...[reaches out]

[Before Catra can touch Adora, voices whoosh and Catra's hand retracts, bones cracking and she painfully groans, then whimpers; Chipped Catra stands straight, bones cracking]

Horde Prime and Chipped Catra: [voices layered together] Disappointing. Some creatures are destined only for destruction.

[Catra's eyes return to normal, then she screams as her chip zaps with electricity; she falls backward]

Adora: [reaching for Catra as she falls off the ledge, shouts] No!

[Adora grunts as she reaches the edge and watches Catra's form as she falls; Adora breathes out, determined, then grunts as she jumps over the edge]


[Horde Prime's throne room, ground level]

[Adora groans as she opens her eyes; she grunts as she touches her head, then gasps when she sees Catra laying nearby; she stands, only to thud to the ground and grunt; she pants as she crawls to Catra]

Adora: [softly, sadly] ...Catra? [she picks up Catra's limp form; with more intense concern, weakly] Catra? It's okay...I'm here.

[Catra breathes softly, weakly; Adora begins to pant, half-sobbing, embracing Catra closer; clones surround the pair]

Horde Prime possessed Clone: [as Adora quietly sobs] I am sorry for the needless waste, Adora. It did not have to be like this. Are you ready to cooperate?

[Adora's hand shakily straightens at the back of Catra's head, then she lowers Catra away from herself; she opens her eyes to reveal a blue magical glow, an energy field whooshing and humming around her; she stands, holding Catra limply in one arm]

Adora: ...For the honor...of...GRAYSKULL!

[She-Ra's sword materializes in her hand magically, a light shinging up the sword; a bright light shines, and She-Ra's form reveals itself from a starry silhouette; Catra breathes lightly in She-Ra's hold; She-Ra tosses Catra lightly onto her shoulder, then swipes her sword at the clones, sending a wave of magical energy that knocks them backward, grunting; she elbows another clone, kicks another, flipping off him, and then blasts the possessed one with a magical beam from the sword; the voices whisper and whoosh as the clone's eyes glare up at She-Ra]

[Scene transitions to Horde Prime standing in front of a monitor showing She-Ra]

She-Ra: You miscalculated.

[The monitor glitches, then crackles with electricity, turning to static, and finally shutting off with a whir; Horde Prime clenches his fist]


[Horde Prime's ship, hallway]

[The ship rumbles as dust and rubble fall from the ceiling; Bow, Glimmer, Entrapta, and Wrong Hordak being pulled by Entrapta's hair, run and pant through the hall; they halt, clones surrounding them on both sides, Glimmer gasps]

Bow: What do we do?

Entrapta: I've got an idea, but you have to promise that you won't be mad that I [nervously, touching her index fingers together] maybe, possibly, [quickly] 100 percent disregarded all those times you told me not to tinker with the ship.

Bow: [nervously, urgently] Entrapta, if you get us out of here, you can tinker with the ship as much as you want!

Entrapta: [screech laughs, causing Wrong Hordak to grunt in surprise; shouts] Great! Hey, Darla! [whistles]

[The ship shakes and rumbles, rubble crashing down; an explosion of dust crashes through the wall; the squad whimpers and braces themselves against falling rubble; as the rubble quiets, Darla's ramp beeps and whirs to thud on the ground]

Entrapta: [happily, walking Wrong Hordak to the ship] Good girl!

[Glimmer whimpers, looking at the destruction behind Darla]

Bow: [urgently] We need to find Adora and get out of here, now!

[A bright magical light hums behind them, causing them to shield their eyes and gasp; She-Ra appears holding Catra in her arms; She-Ra's form sparkles and glows]

Bow: [amazed, softly] She-Ra...

Glimmer: [amazed, happily] She's back...

[She-Ra walks to them; clones appear where she came from; She-Ra hands Catra to Bow, and he and Glimmer run into Darla as She-Ra turns to the clones; She-Ra summons her sword in a high-pitched hum, and the clones rush her, snarling; She-Ra carves magical energy with a few swipes in front of her, then yells, expelling the energy and the clones backward as they shout; She-Ra walks away to the ship]


[Darla's bridge]

[She-Ra walks onto the bridge; Entrapta types away as an alarm beeps continuously]

Darla's interface: [as She-Ra walks to the main console next to Entrapta] Shields at 30 percent. Hull compromised. Interspace travel not recommended.

[She-Ra touches the console and it whirs to life; the bridge hums with power; the interface dings positively]

Darla's interface: Administrator detected. Hello, She-Ra.

She-Ra: Hey, Darla. Get us out of here.

Darla's interface: Affirmative.

[The ship trembles and rubble crashes, sliding off the top as Darla starts up]

She-Ra: And Darla? [sternly] Make it quick.

[She-Ra walks over and kneels next to Catra where Glimmer and Bow have her leaned against their laps on the floor, picking her up into her arms]

She-Ra: [breathes in; quietly] Come on, Catra. You're not done...not yet. [she touches their foreheads together; sadly, tears forming] We're going home.

Catra: [leaning her head against Adora; weakly] Hey, Adora...

[Adora sobs happily, embracing Catra tightly; Catra hesitates, surprised, then returns the embrace tightly; Catra purrs as they continue to hug, Adora sobbing lightly]


[Horde Prime's ship, hallway]

Hordak: [slowly] ...En...trapta?
