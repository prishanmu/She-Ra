Catra: [Disembodied] Pull the switch! And let’s end this.
Adora: [Disembodied] Catra… Please, don’t. No!

Catra: [Disembodied] Adora…

Catra: Adora!

[Adora gasps and grunts]

Catra: Whoa, whoa, whoa! A-Adora! Heh. Since when do you sleep in?

Adora: Where am I? How did I get here?

Catra: Uh, you’re in your room. Are you okay?

Adora: I… I’m fine. I was just having a weird dream. There was something I needed to fix…

Catra: Of course you dream about work. There’s nothing to fix, Adora. Everything’s perfect.

Adora: Yeah…it was just a dream.

Catra: Come on, get up.

[Door opens]

Catra: [calls from outside the room] Adora…

[Adora goes out]

[Theme plays]


Horde Soldiers: Adora… It’s really her! It’s Adora!

Horde Soldiers: Whoo! Yeah! All right! Yes!

Adora: What are they all looking at?

Catra: You! The invasion of Thaymor went perfectly. You’re the hero of the hour.

Adora: Thaymor…

[Flashbacks to S1E2, people screaming as the Horde attacks Thaymor]

Adora: Oh…Yeah! I defeated the rebel insurgents at Thaymor. Yeah. [chuckles] I did that.

Catra: Oh, please, you couldn’t have done it without me.

Adora: Right… What would I ever do without you?

[Adora elbows Catra and both laugh]

Horde Soldier: Hey. Watch where you’re going, twerp. [Hyperventilates] Force Captain! I didn’t know you were-- I’m so sorry.

Adora: You’d better be. Dismissed.

[Catra and Adora both laugh]

Catra: Oh! Force Captain! Don’t hurt me! [Fake groans]

[Catra and Adora both laugh]

Catra: Too good!

Adora: Where are we going again?

Catra: To the locker room. There’s something I wanna show you.

Adora: Then why are we going the long way around? Let’s take the side door right—Huh.

Catra: What? It’s always been this way. Are you sure you’re okay?

Adora: Yeah, I’m okay.

Catra: [Grabs Adora’s face, Adora grunts] Do you have a concussion or something? I know you get hit on the head a lot, but I figured your dumb little hair poof would cushion the blow.

Adora: I’m fine, okay? Don’t make me kick your butt!

Catra: Pfft, as if you could.

[Adora laughs and pounces toward Catra, Catra squeals]


[Catra and Adora continue to play fight, laughing and grunting]

Lonnie: [yelling] Surprise!

Rogelio: [hisses]

Kyle: Surprise.

Adora: What is this? Are those ration bars?

Lonnie: We wouldn’t have been able to defeat the rebels at Thaymor without you. Plus, you were the one who talked Shadow Weaver into letting us come. So, we all pitched in, took Kyle’s ration bars for a week, and made this.

Kyle: I’m hungry, but celebrating your victory is worth it.

Adora: You guys! You even got the gray kind, it’s way better than the brown kind.

Lonnie: Hey, it was Catra’s idea!

Adora: Oh, yeah?

Catra: Eh, whatever, don’t make a big deal about it.

Adora: Wow, I can’t believe you like me, that is so embarrassing for you. [Grabs Catra in a headlock and noogies her, Catra groans]

Catra: Ow! Ugh, stop it! Get off! This is not because I like you!

[Catra and Adora laugh, wrestling and grunting]

Kyle: [grunts] No. No, no, no! [Shouts as ration bar cake hits the floor]

Lonnie: [yells] Oh, come on, Kyle!

Kyle: Sorry…

[Catra and Adora laugh]

Kyle: Dang it…

[Adora gasps]

Adora: What?

Catra: Hang on. You got something riiiiight…there! [Squishes ration bar sludge against Adora’s cheek, laughs]

Shadow Weaver: Adora.

[Adora gasps]

Shadow Weaver: Get off the floor. You are the Force Captain who sacked Thaymor.

Adora: Sorry, Shadow Weaver.

Shadow Weaver: And you…

[Adora gasps]

Shadow Weaver: Look at you. You’re a mess. Go get yourself cleaned up.

You’re no longer children. I have high hopes for you both. Do not wasted your time on such foolish games.

Catra: Yes, Shadow Weaver.

Shadow Weaver: Adora, come with me.

[Adora runs afterShadow Weaver, Lonnie gives Kyle a fist of ration bar to the face and he grunts]


Shadow Weaver: I will admit, I did not think that Catra and the others were ready to be deployed. But under your command, they performed admirably. You are becoming every bit the leader I always knew you to be.

Adora: Thank you, Shadow Weaver. I couldn’t have done it without them.

Shadow Weaver: Suffice it to say, Hordak is impressed with your performance. He is rewarding you with a new mission.

Adora: Really?

Shadow Weaver: You’ll get the rest of the details at briefing. Look at it, Adora. This is who you are. The Force Captain who will lead the Horde to victory.

[Portal glitches flash, Adora gasps]

Shadow Weaver: It’s what you’ve always dreamed of. Everything is perfect.

Madame Razz: [echoing] Mara, dearie!

[Adora gasps]

Adora: What did you just say?

Shadow Weaver: I said, are you ready for the briefing, Adora? Now run along. Don’t keep the sergeant waiting.

[Adora gasps]


[Force Captains chattering to each other]

Scorpia: Hi. I’m Scorpia.

Adora: Oh, hey. Adora.

Scorpia: You know, I don’t know what it is, but I do not like you. I-It’s just like this gut feeling I have. Maybe it’s that little poof thing you do with your hair. Or how much it draws attention to your gigantic forehead.

Adora: [scoffs] Okay, can everyone lay off my hair today?

Scorpia: And what kind of name is “Adora”, anyway? It’s like, okay, I get it, everyone loves you. But I do not.

Sergeant: Welcome, Force Captains. After the perfect execution of our mission in Thaymor [Adora chuckles and high fives other Force Captains except Scorpia], the Horde is now in a better position than ever to take the rest of Etheria. And here’s our next target: The Salineas Sea Gate, separating Horde Territory from rebel controlled waters…[voice fades into echo] We have a week to plan, and then it’s go-time, people.

[Adora gasps]

Sergeant: Now, it’s possible that you might have to go face-to-face with a Princess. [Adora gasps] They’re powerful and completely devoid of conscience. [Flashbacks of the princesses intersperse this monologue] But it’s possible to take them out.

[Adora shouts as flashbacks continue]

Razz: [disembodied, echoing] What happened to the stars?

Adora: [Shouts] What’s going on?!

Sergeant: Uh, Force Captain Adora? You have something to say?

Adora: Huh? Where’s the screen?

Sergeant: There’s…no screen. All the information should be in your report.

[Adora gasps, and runs out breathing heavily]

Sergeant: Force Captain!


[Adora runs, grunting and breathing as flashbacks continue, stopping and gasping when a portal glitch opens up and disappears, reappearing just as suddenly. Adora shouts as the glitch moves towards her]

Catra: Adora? Adora! [Adora gasps] What is wrong?

Adora: Did you write this?

Catra: Did I write a blank piece of paper? I’m gonna go with no.

Adora: No, there was something—Something there, I—I think. And then I was running. Why was I running?

Catra: Okay, okay, calm down.

Adora: I can’t calm down. There’s something I keep forgetting, there’s something I-I’m supposed to fix. I remember a sword, a b-bright light, and you were there—

[Adora grunts as Catra slaps Adora’s face]

Adora: Ow! What was that?

Catra: Sorry! You were freaking out and it was freaking me out!

Adora: Well, you didn’t have to slap me!

Catra: Come on, let’s get you outside, you need some air.

Adora: No, Catra, I don’t need—[Portal glitch]


Adora: --Air… [breathes] How did we get here?

Catra: We climbed up…like we always do. Don’t you remember?

Adora: I don’t know what’s happening to me. It’s like I’m losing my mind.

Catra: You just need to relax.

Adora: Yeah… Yeah, you’re probably right. I’m--I’m fine. Everything’s fine.

[Portal glitch flashback of Catra]

Catra: [scoffs] Of course I’m right. Everything’s perfect. Soon, the two of us are gonna be ruling Etheria together, just like we always planned.

Adora: Is that what you really want? To rule the world?

Catra: I—I mean, yeah, obviously… Isn’t that what you want, too?

[Flashbacks to real world Catra]

Adora: I don’t know.

Catra: Don’t flake out on me now. This is what we always wanted. Everything will be perfect as long as we stay together.

[Portal glitches]

Adora: What if we don’t stay together? What if it all goes wrong?

[More portal glitches]

Adora: Why can’t you see that?!

Catra: Adora! Stay with me, okay? You’re just seeing things. It’s all in your head.

Lonnie: [shouts] Adora! Catra! Thought we’d find you up there. Get down here! We got big news.

[Portal glitch to lower landing]

Adora: …What?

Lonnie: Okay, okay. We just got word, we’re being sent to Salineas tonight.

[Portal glitches]

Adora: But they said at the briefing that’s not for another week.

Lonnie: Adora? It’s been a week.

[More portal glitches]

Adora: No. [grunting]

Catra: Adora?

Adora: I know this is wrong, can’t you see it?! My memories don’t match, we’re jumping around, things are disappearing, it’s like time and space aren’t working right. And I— [grunts]

Catra: Adora, stop it. [shouts] Stop!

[Flashback to Mara hologram]

Adora: Mara! Portal. I think I remember. None of this is right. [Flashbacks continue] We’re not supposed to be here.

Catra: Adora! Everything’s okay.

Adora: Stop saying that! This isn’t right! Everyone keeps telling me everything is perfect, but it’s not. …Everyone except Scorpia.

Catra: Adora! Adora, where are you going?


Adora: You don’t think things are perfect!

Scorpia: Whoa! Ever hear of personal space? I happen to take it very seriously. And also, …what are you talking about?

Adora: Things aren’t right! You must feel it, too. I’m not sure why yet, but I’m starting to remember. …I need to get into Hordak’s sanctum and you need to help me!

Scorpia: Hordak’s sanctum. [chuckles] I’m not sure if you know, but no one is allowed in there without express permission. I mean [chuckles more], this is basic stuff. Are you sure you’re qualified to be a Force Captain?

Adora: All of my memories stop in Hordak’s sanctum. There’s something in there…something powerful and dangerous, and that’s where it all started. That’s where I have to go to fix things!

Scorpia: Okay, Adora, I totally hear you. Everything’s gonna be fine. [Scorpia reaches her tail up, preparing to strike Adora] In fact, I think I know some nice people who can help if you just—

Adora: [Scorpia’s tail whiffs as Adora moves] Scorpia, you have to remember something. Tell me you remember. Everyone’s acting like things are perfect, except for you… Even Catra is—

Scorpia: Catra… [flashbacks to Catra and Scorpia together]

Adora: You do remember…

Scorpia: No, I—[Flashbacks continue, Catra stunning Entrapta] I mean, I-I don’t know. And Catra she—she was just scared, she didn’t mean to—What is going on? I keep-I keep forgetting things. This… This is all wrong. How did we get here?

Adora: I don’t know. All I know is that we have to get to Hordak’s sanctum. [Portal glitch]

Scorpia: HOW DID WE GET HERE?

Adora: Just go with it, okay? We need to get past those guards.

Scorpia: Oh, man, this is a bad plan! What happens if we get caught? We are so fired!

[Adora shushes Scorpia, who shushes back. The shushing continues until they both swat at each other]

Scorpia: Enough, stop it. [Adora grunting] Don’t, just—just move, move.

Horde soldier: Hey! What are you doing here? Hands up!

[Portal glitch]

[Scorpia shouts, then gasps]

Scorpia: [Shouts and grabs her tail] Did I just do that?! I am so fired.

Adora: Scorpia. You need to focus. None of that matters.

Scorpia: I don’t like this.

[Portal glitch noises]

Scorpia: Uh, wasn’t there a door here just a second ago?

Adora: [Exhales] Things are disappearing. It’s getting worse. We have to hurry, there’s-there’s gotta be another way in. …There! It’s that lady!

Scorpia: What lady?

Adora: The one who says “Mara.” Come on!

Scorpia: Okay, that makes no sense! But I’m gonna follow you because I don’t see a lot of other options.

[Both run down the hallway]

Adora: Wait!

[Adora breathing and grunting]

Scorpia: [Heavy breathing] Oh, she’s so fast. …Okay. [coughs slightly]

[Razz, disembodied, humming]

[Adora runs, grunting]

Scorpia: [panting] Why… is everyone… so… fast? Whoa.

Adora: This is it. Come on.

Scorpia: I hope this works.

Adora: It will. And then you can go back to hating me.

Scorpia: Look. If you get us out of this, I promise I won’t hate you. I will just dislike you a reasonable amount.

Adora: Deal.

[Both walk further in]

Adora: No. No, no…

[Flashback of sword and portal]

Adora: This can’t be right. It was here, it was right here. Where is it?! [Groans]

[Flashbacks of Catra pulling the lever]

Adora: Catra. It was Catra. Catra did this, she captured me, she took-- …the sword. She activated the portal.

Scorpia: Sword?

Adora: The sword. There’s supposed to be a sword. My sword. But it’s gone. It’s in the portal! That’s why we’re here, I need to find it!

[Imp chittering, Adora gasps]

Scorpia: [gasps] Quick, hide!

[Both run behind a desk. Hordak steps into the room, the imp flying and chittering. Scorpia and Adora exhale]

Scorpia: That was close.

[Imp screeches, Scorpia shouts]

Adora: Run!

[Portal glitches]

Scorpia: What is happening?! I don’t understand what is going on! Adora, wait! Wait up! [Scorpia swallowed by portal]

Adora: [gasps] Scorpia? Scorpia!

[Portal glitch inches closer, Adora groans and runs, grunting]

Adora: Wait!

Razz: Why, hello, Mara, dearie!

Adora: Who are you? Why do I know you? What are you doing in the Fright Zone? Is this real?

Razz: I am afraid so, dearie. But you can still fix it. There’s still time!

[Portal glitches divide land, Adora gasps and grunts]

Razz: Find me in the woods, dearie!

Lonnie: Adora! Adora, where have you been?!

Adora: Lonnie, we have to get out of here. Where are Kyle and Rogelio?

Lonnie: Who?

Adora: Our…teammates since we were kids. Where are they?

Lonnie: Uh…I don’t remember… I think… I think they’re gone? [Shouts as portal divides the land more] What is going on?!

Adora: Come on!

[Lonnie and Adora panting and grunting, Adora closes the door]

Adora: Lonnie, we have to… [shouts and pounds the door]

[Adora grunts and continues to run away from impending portal glitches]

Adora: Catra!

Catra: Adora—

[Adora opens door and shoves Catra in]

Catra: Hey! You’ve officially lost it, haven’t you?!

Adora: Listen, we have to go. Now! Scorpia, Lonnie, Kyle, Rogelio, they’re all gone.

Catra: What are you talking about? Who’s gone?

Adora: They’re gone! There’s nothing left. And we’ll be next if we don’t get out of here right now.

Catra: [Grunts] You’re not making any sense. Everything’s fine, okay? It’s--

Adora: Don’t say it’s perfect! I know it’s not perfect, and so do you!

[Catra gasps, flashbacks to the portal]

Catra: You’ve gone crazy. I’m not going anywhere.

Adora: Catra…

Catra: What are you--?! [Grunts as Adora stuns her]

[Portal glitches, Adora runs, carrying Catra. Adora drives a skiff to the woods]

[Catra and Adora grunt and fight over the stun baton on the skiff]

Adora: [shouts] Catra, no!

[Catra and Adora fall off the skiff, yelling, grunting as they run for the stun baton]

Adora: Catra, you can’t. We need to get as far from the Fright Zone as possible or we’ll be completely erased along with everything else.

Catra: [strains] You think you can convince me by kidnapping me?! What is wrong with you?

[Adora grunts as she hits the ground, then again as she kicks the stun baton away]

Adora: I won’t leave you behind again.

Catra: Why can’t you just stay? We have everything we ever wanted.

Adora: It’s not real, Catra. As much as I wish that things could be simple the way they used to be, there’s no going back.

[Catra shouts in rage as she shoves Adora away, Adora tackles Catra and they both grunt]

Adora: Why did you do it?

Catra: I don’t know what you’re talking about!

[Portal glitching reaches the nearby forest]

Adora: There’s no time. We have to go.

[Catra grunts as she flashes back to their childhood promise]

Young Adora: You look out for me and I look out for you. Nothing really bad can happen as long as we have each other.

Young Catra: You promise?

Young Adora: I-

[Back to the present]

Adora: [syncing with Young Adora] I promise. Everything will be okay if we just stay together.

[Flashback to S1E2]

Past Adora: Come with me. You don’t have to go back there. We can fix this.

[Back to the present]

Adora: Help me fix this. Please!

[Catra groans]

Adora: This can’t be what you wanted!

Catra: Don’t you get it?! I am never going to go with you!

[Adora gasps, Catra laughs maniacally]

Catra: You always have to go and ruin it, don’t you?

[Catra shouts as she tackles Adora, both grunting as they fight]

Adora: Catra, look what’s happening! You’re going to destroy everything!

Catra: I don’t care. I won’t let you win. I’d rather see the whole world end than let that happen.

[The portal glitching gets closer, an abyss growing behind Catra. Catra tries to drag Adora closer, both are grunting with effort.]

Adora: Catra, no!

[The ground divides them. Catra falls toward the portal abyss, Adora away from it]

Adora: Catra!

[Catra holds on by one piece of the ledge, then lets go. Adora looks on and tears up. She runs away, then falls to her knees and sobs]

Razz: Oh, is that you, Mara? [gasps] You made it after all.

[Flashback to meeting Madame Razz, S1E3]

Adora: Madame Razz.

Razz: It’s been such a long time since we last saw each other, hasn’t it? That or…it hasn’t happened yet. I always get those two things mixed up.

Adora: I couldn’t save anyone else.

Razz: It’s not too late. You can still bring them back, but you must act quickly.

Adora: How do you know all of this?!

Razz: Because this has all happened before! I remember it like it was yesterday. For Madame Razz, it was yesterday…

Adora: This happened before…with Mara!

Razz: Yes, dearie. When she moved Etheria and took away the stars. Heh, it was crazy.

Adora: It’s all my fault. I’ve been so afraid of becoming another Mara. Destroying the world the way she did…and now…it’s happening.

[Adora grunts as Razz hits her with Broom]

Razz: Destroy the world? [Chuckles] No. Mara saved the world, and so will you. But you can’t waste any more time. You need to go back to the beginning. You need to find the sword. That is the only way this will stop!

Adora: I did that, didn’t I? I went back to the Fright Zone. The portal wasn’t there!

Razz: No, that wasn’t the beginning. You need to go back to the very beginning.

Adora: I-I-I don’t understand.

Razz: That’s all right, dearie. You don’t need to understand. You just need to remember.

[Trees crash as the portal glitching comes closer]

Adora: I have to remember…

[Flashbacks of the Best Friend Squad]

Adora: [Gasps] Bow and Glimmer. I need to find them!

Razz: Go on, dearie! Quickly!
