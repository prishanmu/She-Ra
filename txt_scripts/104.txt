Glimmer: This is awesome! I can't believe Mom agreed to let you stay in Bright Moon!

Adora: Yeah, awesome.

Glimmer: Okay. You've seen the dining room, throne room, portrait hall. So, the last stop on our grand tour is... your new room! Ta-da!



Glimmer: It's pretty standard. You've got your vanity, the bathroom, crystals, bell pull, tea nook, more crystals, bed, desk, and of course, the waterfall.

Adora: Is the waterfall for showering?

Glimmer: Ha! Good one, Adora. "Waterfall for showering." [Laughs] I'm right down the hall if you need anything. Night.

Adora: Wait--



Adora: Okay. This is different than the Fright Zone, but I'm sure I'll get the hang of this in no time. [Grunts] Help.

Adora: [Grunting] Come on, get flatter! No! Go back in! Go back in! [Shouting] [Whispering] Glimmer? Glimmer? I think I killed the bed. [Shrieks] [Normal voice] Ma'am! I mean, Your Majesty. Sir! [Coughs] So, what are you doing up?

Angella: When I feel the cares of the day weighing upon me, I come here.

Adora: Who is that?

Angella: King Micah. My husband. He built the Rebellion with me. And he was one of the first casualties of The Horde.

Adora: Sorry. I didn't know.

Angella: Adora. My daughter believes you can help us. Glimmer has vouched for you despite your background. And because I greatly love my daughter, I am willing to give you a chance. Do not disappoint her.


[Glimmer snoring]

[Yawning]

[Adora and Glimmer scream]

[Grunts]

Adora: [Gasps] Glimmer! Are you okay?

Glimmer: What are you doing in here?

Adora: I'm sorry! I couldn't sleep in my room. I've never slept without any other people around. And then I ran into your mom, I think she doesn't like me.

Glimmer: What? My mom loves you.

Adora: Yeah, sure. She loves She-Ra.

Glimmer: Mom can be... a little intense, heh. But, our weekly meeting with the Rebellion Generals is today and you're invited. She wouldn't have invited you if she didn't like you.


Perfuma &amp; She-Ra S1 Still
Adora: Wow. Heh.

Glimmer: Come on. Meeting's about to start.

Adora: Uh, the chairs are still empty.

Glimmer: Those are for the other Etherian Princesses, but... none of them have been active members since I was a kid. The Rebellion had a big defeat years ago, and most of the old Princesses gave up. Now all the kingdoms keep to themselves, and the new Princesses do the same.

Bow: Other than Spinnerella and Netossa.
Hey, guys! [Whispers] We're not really sure what they do.

Adora: Ah.


Adora: What? What? I don't understand.

Angella: This is not your chair.

Glimmer: Sorry! First day. Won't happen again!

Adora: [Whispers] What did I do?

Glimmer: [Whispers] You sat in my dad's chair.

Adora: [Whispers] Oh... Oh. I'm sorry.

Angella: I've asked you here because I've received a distress call from Princess Perfuma. The Horde is laying siege to her kingdom. She's asking Bright Moon for assistance. General?

Bright Moon General: Perfuma's kingdom, Plumeria, is located near the front lines.The Horde has set up camp in their territory, cutting off their main supply route

Angella: Bright Moon will provide food and humanitarian aid.

Glimmer: [Oos] I have a better idea. We can--

Angella: Fight the Horde? Glimmer, you propose this idea every meeting.

Glimmer: No! I was going to say, let's use aggressive fist-to-face sparkles.

Angella: I said, no, Glimmer. Now sit down!

[Glimmer huffs]

Adora: You should send me, Glimmer, and Bow to lead the relief mission.You can send me as She-Ra. I'll make sure everyone gets there safely and protect Bow and Glimmer if the Horde attacks. I promise, I won't disappoint you.

Angella: [Sighs] Very well. You will deliver food and supplies to Plumeria, and under no circumstances will you engage the Horde. You leave at dawn.


[Metal clanging, grunting]

Kyle: [Shouts] I give up! I give up!

Lonnie: [Grunts] Quit playing around, Kyle! Where's Catra? She's supposed to be here.

Catra: Not anymore, cadet Lonnie.

[Kyle shouting]

Lonnie: Why aren't you dressed?

Catra: Oh, Lonnie, Lonnie... sweet, dumb, Lonnie. [taps badge]

Lonnie: They made you Force Captain?

Kyle: Congrats, Catra! [shouting]

Catra: Hordak knows a good thing when he sees it. Now that I'm in charge, Shadow Weaver won't be the only one...Uh...

[Kyle grunts]


Catra: What do ya need, Shadow Weaver? Ooh, are you giving me my first mission?

Shadow Weaver: You will explain how you lost Force Captain Adora.

Catra: [Groans] Ugh, I've told you everything I know about Adora! [slams locker]

Shadow Weaver: I know you're lying. You have to be lying. What happened to Adora? What did you do?

Catra: What did I do? She left us! She left me! You ever think Adora's not as loyal as you thought?

Shadow Weaver: I will learn the truth, Catra, even if I have to drag it from your--

[Shadow Weaver shouting]

[Catra grunts]

Shadow Weaver: Out of my way!


[Children laughing]

Glimmer: Wow. Mom didn't say anything about all the plants dying.

Bow: I don't think she knows. Wait, where's Adora?

[She-Ra grunts]

Glimmer: Are you gonna be She-Ra the entire time we're here?

She-Ra: I told Queen Angella I would. Besides, people like me better as She-Ra. [Chuckles] Could Adora do this? [Grunts]

Glimmer: Hmm. Yep. Very useful to our mission.

Bow: Hey, guys. What is that?

She-Ra: Must be coming from the Horde camp.

Perfuma: You're here!

Glimmer: Princess Perfuma. I'm Commander Glimmer of--

Bow: Ooh, I get a hat.

Perfuma: [Gasps] Oh, my. Everyone, come quick! It's, Oh, it's… It's… [Shouts] Look! The universe has heard our pleas and sent the legendary She-Ra to help us save our home.

She-Ra: [Sets down cart, Clears throat] We heard about the blockade and we've come to help. We brought food and supplies for you.

[Perfuma whimpers]

Perfuma: Welcome to Plumeria, She-Ra.

She-Ra: Um, Glimmer, what's happening?

Perfuma: Come with me, I'll show you around. You're gonna love it.

[Baby cooing]


Perfuma: Our people have lived here for thousands of years. We're known for our beautiful flowers, our majestic trees. And this is the Heart-Blossom, the center of our kingdom, and the source of all my magical powers.

Bow: At least this tree is fine. What happened to everything else?

Perfuma: We're going through a little rough patch, but I'm sure the universe will right itself soon.

Glimmer: Everything is dead or dying.

Perfuma: Look, the blight hit right after the Horde arrived. We don't know why, and nothing I do stops it. But we don't dwell on the negative. Look at the positive. The Heart-Blossom is still healthy, and the She-Ra is here, and the celebration's about to begin.

She-Ra: Celebration? [Grunts]


[Door opens]

[Shadow Weaver groans, breathing heavily]

Shadow Weaver: You will not refuse me!

Hordak: Shadow Weaver.

Shadow Weaver: Lord Hordak!

Hordak: You have disobeyed my orders.

Shadow Weaver: I've done no such thing, Lord Hordak. My will is your will.

Hordak: Then explain to me why you've requisitioned more troops to look for one missing soldier. A soldier I ordered you to give up on.

Shadow Weaver: Finding Adora is crucial to the Horde's mission—

Hordak: [Slams armrest] Our mission is to kill the Whispering Woods so we can march on Bright Moon. Our mission is to destroy the princesses and their ridiculous rebellion. You are distracted, Shadow Weaver. Our ground troops demand your full attention. The siege on Plumeria has carried on for too long. You will give the order to increase power until victory is achieved. And never forget, I gave you your magical power and at my slightest whim, [whispers] I can take it away. [Normal voice] Understand?

Shadow Weaver: Of course, Lord Hordak.




She-Ra: No, no, no, it's okay. You need this food more than we do.

Plumerian elder: Nonsense. It is our honor to serve the She-Ra.

She-Ra: No, no, no, it's okay. You need this food more than we do.

Plumerian elder: Nonsense. It is our honor to serve the She-Ra.

[Food crunches]

Perfuma: We are so honored to have you.

Plumerian Citizen 1: Whoa. That's She-Ra.

Perfuma: Yes, I know. The She-Ra, right? I'm so happy that after all these centuries of being gone, you've finally returned. I said, break out party kale. And at our hour of greatest need, just like in the stories.

She-Ra: What stories?

Perfuma: The stories we've been telling for thousands of years. She-Ra, the warrior who tamed the beasts of Beast Island with a single word.

Bow: That's nothing. What about the time She-Ra defeated a squad of Horde soldiers on a flying horse? Or the time she saved Thaymor from a legion of Horde soldiers? Or the time she borrowed my toothbrush and used it to defeat an army of Horde soldiers.

She-Ra: Uh, Bow, that's not true.

Bow: You're right. It was two armies!

[all cheering]

She-Ra: Uh...

[Baby coos]

Glimmer: Hey, calm down! Give her some space. One at a time. You first.

She-Ra: Oh! Thank you for the…

Glimmer: [Whispers] Windchime.

She-Ra: Wind-chime.

[Explosion nearby]

Perfuma: We're so excited for you to heal our land and bring all the plants back to life. Will you be doing it before the drum circle or after?

She-Ra: You want me to--You want me to heal your land?

Perfuma: Yes! Like in the ancient story, "She-Ra Heals the Forest And Brings The Trees Back To Life."

Glimmer:  I've seen her do way weirder stuff. This'll be a snap.

She-Ra: Wait, it's not that simple. Plus, I don't like the look of that smoke. The Horde's up to something big. Maybe we should investigate.

Perfuma: We? This is my power. I grow plants. We're not strong enough to go up against the Horde. All we want is to live peacefully in our ancestral home.

Bow: And then She-Ra saved the day once again!

[Child laughs.]

Perfuma: We need you, She-Ra.

[All chanting] She-Ra! She-Ra! She-Ra!

She-Ra: Yes, healing. That is a thing I know how to do. I just need to take Bow and Glimmer over to those trees for a moment. I know what I'm doing!


She-Ra: [Whispers] I don't know what I'm doing! I can't heal anything!

Bow: But, the stories say you have healing powers.

She-Ra: They also say I fought the Mantisaur. I don't even know what that is!

Glimmer: Why don't you just concentrate really hard? That seems to work whenever you need to transform.

She-Ra: [Deep breaths] Okay.

[She-Ra grunting]

She-Ra: Did I do it?

Bow: No, you punched a tree. That's kinda the opposite of healing.

She-Ra: Let me try again. [chuckles]

[She-Ra grunts]

[Glimmer shrieks]

Glimmer: Magic blast. Also not healing.

She-Ra: I'll get it this time.

[She-Ra grunts]

[Animal screeches.]

Glimmer: Magical transformation?

Bow: Wait, is that what happened to our horse?

[She-Ra grunts]

[Thudding]

Bow: It's okay. You'll get it soon.

She-Ra: Soon isn't good enough! These people expect me to save their land. I thought I was better as She-Ra, but I'm useless no matter what form I take.

[Explosion nearby]

Bow: My hat!

Perfuma: She-Ra! Come quickly! Something absolutely terrible has happened!


Perfuma: The Heart-Blossom is dying. Please, She-Ra, heal our land.

She-Ra: Oh, come on, do something.

[She-Ra grunting]

She-Ra: No. [Sighs]

[All gasping]

Adora: Sorry. I don't know how to heal.

Plumerian Citizen 2: Who are you? And where's She-Ra?

Adora: My name is Adora. I was chosen to carry the sword of She-Ra, but... I haven't been doing this for very long, and I don't know exactly how it works yet.

Plumerian elder: She's just a girl!

Adora: I never meant to deceive you. I am She-Ra, I'm just not the same She-Ra.

Perfuma: Then you can't save us?

[explosion nearby]

[all gasping]

[all crying]

Adora: Wait! There might be another way. I know the Horde. I think they're using one of their machines to poison your land. If we wanna save your home, we have to stop them!

Plumerian Citizen 2: You're not She-Ra from the stories. You were supposed to save us.

Perfuma: It will be all right, I promise. We will rebuild. We have to believe that the universe will repay the Horde for their evil deeds eventually.

Glimmer: The universe won't protect you! You want She-Ra to fix everything, but won't even try to save yourselves? At least Adora's trying.

Perfuma: If She-Ra can't save us, no one can. Right now, we just need to make sure our people are safe. We leave today.

Glimmer: Are you okay?

Adora: I just wanted to help. But all I've done is disappoint an entire kingdom. I'm sorry I let you guys down after you talked me up.

Bow: We just wanted everyone to see what an awesome person you are. I thought I was being supportive, but I was being terrible!

Glimmer: Adora, She-Ra's not the reason we like you. We like you because you're our friend.

[Explosion nearby]

Glimmer: You have a plan, don't you?

Adora: Yeah. I think I do.


Adora: All clear. Okay, we need to find the machine. Every Horde camp is laid out the same. Guard duty's in half-hour shifts, so we walk in when the shift changes in three, two, one.

Horde soldier 1: Shift change!

Horde soldier 2: Finally! Boring shifts go by slower.

[Adora gasps]

Glimmer: [gasps] You were right. The Horde is poisoning the land.

Horde soldier: Hey! What are you doing here?

Adora: [Scoffs] What are you doing here? We have security clearance, password 5-echo-niner. On your way.

Horde solider: We haven't used that password in months. Hands up!

[alarm wailing]

Bow: Adora? What do we do?

Adora: Run!


Plumerian Citizen 2: Hey, the Bright Moon guys left.

Perfuma: "We've gone to the Horde camp to find the weapon killing your trees. If we don't make it, I wanted to say I'm sorry. I couldn't be the hero you wanted. -Adora." She's still trying, even though we were so negative. Glimmer was right. This is our home, we can't let her do this alone! Everyone, She-Ra and our friends from Bright Moon are risking their lives to protect us from the Horde. We need to help them! Get the warchimes, we march!

[all cheering]


[all shouting, blasting, crashing, grunting]

Adora: How many soldiers can you take?

Bow: Between one and zero. [panting] Whoo.

Glimmer: [panting] I'll take them all, if you give me a minute.

[soldiers shouting]

[horn wailing]

Perfuma: I've always said the universe will repay the Horde one day. Well, I guess that day is today!

Plumerian Child: For the She-Ra!

[all shouting]

Glimmer: Hey. Ooh. [chuckles, grunts]

Perfuma: I've never been so alive!

Adora: [grunting and shouting] For the honor of Grayskull!

[She-Ra transformation theme]

[She-Ra grunting and shouting]

She-Ra: For Etheria! [shouts]

[Perfuma gasps, then laughs]

Horde Soldier: Ew! Yuck!

Horde Soldier: [yelling] Retreat! Retreat!

Perfuma: Thank you so much! You inspired us to save ourselves. How can we ever repay you?

Glimmer: Join the Rebellion, and help me reform the Princess Alliance.

Perfuma: Um, are you sure? Didn't that go horribly the first time?

Glimmer: It went horribly for our parents. But we have a chance to do it right. We're clearly stronger together. Think what all the Princesses united could do.

Perfuma: Would I get to hit more people with flowers?

Glimmer: Absolutely.

Perfuma: You have a deal. Hey, everyone! Look at us. We're mighty rebels now.

[All cheering]


[Door closes]

Catra: Force Captain Catra reporting for--

Shadow Weaver: This was brought to me by retreating soldiers, retreating because their camp was attacked by Adora and She-Ra. Pathetic, you're still trying to protect her. Did you think you could keep the truth from me?

Catra: It's just a phase, she's confused. I'll bring her back in, I swear.

Shadow Weaver: Oh, yes, you will. Because until I tell you otherwise, that is your mission. And to ensure success, no matter where Adora goes, no matter how long it takes, my shadow spies will find her.

[Catra gasps]

Shadow Weaver: Find her and bring her home.


[Door opens]

Adora: What is this? [Chuckles]

Glimmer: Since you've never slept in a room by yourself before, Bow and I thought we'd throw you a sleepover, then you won't feel so alone.

Bow: We even got you a new bed.

Adora: [gasps, whispers] It's wonderful.

Bow: We can do this tomorrow too, since Glimmer's grounded for ignoring orders.

Glimmer: For one week.That's three weeks less than normal. And Mom said she'd consider my plan to recruit new Princesses into the rebellion!

Adora: Thanks, guys. I might not ever be the perfect hero everybody wants me to be, but that's okay.

[Adora grunts]

Glimmer: Of course it's okay. Do you have any idea how annoying you'd be if you were perfect?

[Glimmer and Adora laughing]

Bow: Aw! Best Friend Squad is having a pillow fight!

Adora: Yeah, we're not calling ourselves that.

Glimmer: I prefer "The Glimmer Group.”

Bow: Nah. We're the Best Friend Squad.
