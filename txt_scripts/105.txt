[Open on Bright Moon Council room. Spinerella, Netossa, a guard, Glimmer, Adora, and Bow are seated around a table. Angella sits on a fancy chair higher than all the rest.]

Angella: Council, we're looking for plans to strengthen our defenses against the Horde. Who would like to go first?

[Glimmer's hand shoots up.]

Glimmer: Me, me, me. Me. Me, me.

[Angella sighs.]

Angella: Who besides Glimmer would like to go first?

[Glimmer stands.]

Glimmer: Mom-- Uh, eugh, your majesty. You should let me, Bow, and Adora continue our princess recruitment mission. If we can form a new Princess Alliance, The Rebellion would actually stand a chance for once.

Angella: The princesses withdrew from the last alliance. They chose to focus on protecting their own lands.

Glimmer: So, are we supposed to just... give up? Please, let me try. All I'm proposing is a diplomatic mission.

Angella: [resigned] So, what do you propose?

[Glimmer activates a holographic map of Etheria.]

Glimmer: Anyone approaching Bright Moon by sea needs to pass through the Salineas Sea Gate. It's controlled by Mermista now that her father's retired. With her on our side, the Rebellion could control the seas. We NEED this alliance with her, Mom.

[Arrows appear on the map as Glimmer talks to illustrate her point. After she finishes talking, the map vanishes.]

Angella: The journey is treacherous, Glimmer. I'm not sure.

Glimmer: Don't worry, Mom. With She-Ra, we can conquer anything.

Adora: And, uh, we're also gonna need a boat.

Glimmer: With She-Ra and a boat, we can conquer anything.

Bow: Aaaaand an experienced sea captain.

[Glimmer makes an annoyed yell.]

Glimmer: With She-Ra, a boat, and an experienced sea captain, [through gritted teeth] we can conquer anything.

Angella: [resigned] Very well.

[Glimmer gasps.]

Glimmer: Yes!

[Glimmer teleports to kiss Angella and hug her.]

Angella: I mean it, Glimmer. No violence, and no collateral damage.

[Glimmer teleports between Bow and Adora, throwing her hands over them.]

Glimmer: [rapidly] Thanks, Mom, you won't regret it.

[Angella sighs. Intro plays. We see many flying boats outside a building on a cliff. Cut to Bow, Adora, and Glimmer entering. Various Etherians are cheering, drinking, making deals, playing cards. Cut to Bow, Adora, and Glimmer at the entrance. Bow looks excited.]

Bow: This is so cool. Seaworthy is just like I imagined it. Everyone here looks like a real pirate!

Glimmer: Focus, Bow. We're just here to find a sea captain.

Bow: No pirates?

Glimmer: No pirates.

Bow: [sadly] Arrrr.

Adora: None of these people look qualified to sail a ship.

[Glimmer goes up to the bar.]

Glimmer: Excuse me.

[Glimmer chuckles. She oohs as the camera pans to a muscular lady with short hair and an anchor tattoo.]

Glimmer: Er, we're looking for a sea captain to take us to Salineas.

[The lady points to two Etherians arm wrestling, surrounded by spectators. Sea Hawk wins the match.]

Sea Hawk: I won. Drinks all around. Put it on my friend here's tab.

[The trio approach him nervously.]

Glimmer: Uh, [chuckles] hiiii. We were told you're a sea captain?

Sea Hawk: I am the one and only Sea Hawk.

[Sea Hawk jumps up onto the table.]

Sea Hawk: Has my reputation preceded me?

Bow: [in awe] Your name is Sea Hawk? That's the coolest name I've ever heard!

[Glimmer and Sea Hawk sit at the table.]

Glimmer: Captain Sea Hawk, we're interviewing potential captains to take us to Salineas. Would you like to apply for the position?

Sea Hawk: [laughing] Apply for the position? I am the one and only Sea Hawk. I'm offer only.

[Adora puts her hands on the table.]

Adora: [exasperated] Okay. Just because "Sea" is in your name, doesn't tell us anything about your ACTUAL qualifications.

[Sea Hawk stands, putting his hands on the table and matching Adora's pose.]

Sea Hawk: Qualifications? I once ran the 50-klick Galebreath Gauntlet in less than 20 klicks. I maneuvered the straits of Serpentine with nary a chip in the paint of my bow. My shanties are considered so desirable, that sirens fling THEMSELVES into the sea at the sound of them. And because I can tell you're wondering, my mustache is... naturally shiny.

[Bow leans in to look at Sea Hawk's mustache.]

Bow: It IS shiny. You're hired.

[Glimmer elbows Bow aside and pushes in front of him.]

Bow: Ow.

Sea Hawk: Whoa, there, kids. What makes you think you can afford me?

Glimmer: I assure you, Captain Sea Hawk, money is no object.

[Sea Hawk hands Glimmer a folded piece of paper.]

Sea Hawk: Behold my fee.

[Glimmer opens the paper, gasps, and closes it again.]

Glimmer: Money might be an object. You know what, fine. We'll just find ANOTHER sea captain.

Sea Hawk: Good luck with that. You won't find another soul who knows the treacherous route to Salineas as well as I do. I brave it often to visit my close personal friend, Princess Mermista.

Glimmer: [gasps] You know her?

Sea Hawk: Uh do I?

[Adora laughs, slamming her hand down on the table. She sits down and holds her other arm up.]

Adora: Okay, well, here's the deal. We go one round, winner takes all. You win, we leave you alone. I win, you take us to Salineas. At no cost.

Sea Hawk: That's a terrible deal. But I am undefeated at arm wrestling. Let me show you how it's done, lassie.

[They grunt furiously as they arm wrestle.]

Bow: Go Adoraaaa, put him in the dirt.

Glimmer: This is so dumb.

Sea Hawk: Ha! Is this the best you've got? I once beat a Tyrosaur with biceps the size of my head in an arm-wrestling match that lasted two weeks.

[Adora shoves his hand onto the table.]

Adora: Ha!

Bow: Yeah! [laughs, high fives Adora]

Sea Hawk: [frowning] Well, truth be told, I let you win so as to, ahem, boost your confidence. [clears throat] I've been wanting to go to Salineas anyway. [hops over the table to their side] Come on, kids, with me! Forward to adventure!

[A shadow spy looms watching on the balcony above, magical energy hissing as it disperses itself to follow them]


[Scene transition to the Fright Zone, inside the Black Garnet chamber; Shadow Weaver stands with Catra at her magical reflecting pool]

Shadow Weaver: Adora is in Seaworthy. I'm giving you one more chance to bring her back.

Catra: Uh...didn't Hordak just order to you to stop going after Adora?

Shadow Weaver: And who is going to tell him? You?

Catra: Fine. About time you started treating me like a Force Captain anyway. I'll bring her back.

Shadow Weaver: [chidingly] Not so faaast. You won't be going alone. You'll be joined by Force Captain Scorpia.

[Scorpia's footsteps thunder as she walks in]

Scorpia: [intimidating silence, then happily] ...KITTY! [Picks up Catra and she groans] Just so you know, I'm a hugger.

[Scorpia hugs Catra, and Catra squeaks and grunts, struggling to get away, finally leaping out of her hold]

Catra: Is this some kind of joke?!

Shadow Weaver: Scorpia will see that you are...kept in line.

Catra: [groans angrily] Ugh. Okay, whatever. You're at least giving me a vehicle, right?

Shadow Weaver: Something like that.


[At sea, a Horde ship]

[Catra nauseously looks over the edge of the ship as the ships' metal creaks and the waves whoosh in its wake]

Catra: [nervously] No...not--

Scorpia: BOATS! Oh, I just love boats, don't you? [Wind blows] Wind in your hair, [Catra groans slightly] ocean on every side, miles and miles from the nearest dry land...[Catra groans slightly louder at Scorpia's increased volume] watery death awaiting at the slightest mishap... Man...[water licks up near where Catra leans against the railing and she shrieks and falls backward, righting herself again shortly] that's what I call living.

Catra: [nauseated] Yeah, I'm really gonna need you to shut up...

Scorpia: [concerned] Aw, are you seasick?

[Catra huffs a groan and scrapes her claws through the metal railing; Catra then grunts when Scorpia picks her up]

Scorpia: Now, just focus on me, okay? It'll help.

Catra: [grunting as she struggles to get away] Put me down! [she pushes out of Scorpia's arms to land on the ship again; she begins to angrily stride away, Scorpia in tow] What is wrong with you?

[They notice Lonnie, Kyle, and Rogelio standing nearby, the ball on Kyle's cup-ball toy tapping and then stopping when he sees Catra and Scorpia]

Catra: What are you looking at? [Kyle's cup-ball toy squeaks as it bounces off his head in his nervousness; Lonnie runs away while Rogelio lifts Kyle and follows] Get back to doing boat things.


[At sea, Sea Hawk's ship]

[Flag flaps]

Sea Hawk: [gesturing widely at his ship] Welcome aboard The Dragon's Daughter...III.

Adora: [scoffs] What happened to The Dragon's Daughters I and II?

Sea Hawk: Tragically, they went down in flames...

Bow: [in awe] How did that happen?

Sea Hawk: [shamelessly] I set them on fire. [leaps to the front of the bow and points ahead] ADVENTURE!

Adora: [to Glimmer, quietly] Are we sure about this guy?

Glimmer: [quietly] He just needs to get us there.

Sea Hawk: You'll of course be expected to earn your keep by helping out around the ship. Never fear I will teach you everything you need to know...in shanty form! [begins to vocalize] Oooooh--! [spots Bow tightening a rope knot and hops to him, ending his singing] --What are you doing?

Bow: Oh. I noticed your mainsail wasn't secured, so I fixed it.

Sea Hawk: Tying proper knots is a task that takes years to master... You did these just now?!

Bow: Yes! [Blushing, Bow's inner thoughts can be heard, voice cracking in excitement] Sea Hawk is impressed with my knots! This is the best day of my life!

Sea Hawk: Excellent work. [places hand on Bow's shoulder] Even if it is just beginner's luck... [walking to Glimmer] We'll also need to set a lookout. [slams himself down to sit next to Glimmer, half-leaning on her and she grunts in surprise] Come on, Sparkle, [Glimmer groans in annoyance] we'll sing a shanty duet and I'll show you how to climb the ratlines... [begins vocalizing] Ooooooh--!

[Glimmer teleports to the crow's nest and Sea Hawk gasps, falling back a little against the railing]

Sea Hawk: Wait, how did she--

Adora: [walking up] I unfurled the jib.

Sea Hawk: By yourself? [sputtering] Not even a sailor as experienced as...me could do that.

Adora: [in mock realization] Oh, so what you're saying is [gasps slightly; smugly] I'm better at this than you are?

Glimmer: [teleports next to Adora; smugly] And the name is Glimmer.

Sea Hawk: Well, you are a strangely overqualified crew. ...What do you even need old Sea Hawk for?

Glimmer: [holding her hand out] Your map?[Sea Hawk's shirt rustles as he digs for the map and hands it to Glimmer; Glimmer teleports back to the crow's nest] Can we focus on our super important mission, here? More sailing, less shanty-ing.

Sea Hawk: [pouts; then happily] Of course, Shimmer! A top secret mission from the Queen! I'll get you there straight away. I'm as excited to see my dearest Mermista as [enunciates] I know she is to see me.

Glimmer: [shouts angrily] My name is Glimmer--!

Sea Hawk: [cutting her off by singing] Oooooooh!

[Sea Hawk's Shanty]

I'm Sea Hawk, I am, I am

If you're looking for adventure, then I am your man

If you want to ride / On the waves of deepest blue

Through perilous winds / Then I got you

Some say I'm a hero / Some say I'm a man!

What I know for sure is / I'm Sea Hawk, I am, I am!

[Bow plays the violin as Sea Hawk laughs and says "Adventure."]

[Shanty ends; Time passes, and there are metal creaking noises as a ship graveyard comes into view; Glimmer looks down at the map and the paper flutters]

Glimmer: Something's wrong... According to the map, we're way off-course.

[Glimmer looks down at Adora and Sea Hawk grunting on the deck as they arm-wrestle, Bow cheering them on from the side]

Bow: [cheering] WHOO! Yeah, let's go! Go, Adora. Yeah!

Adora: [slamming Sea Hawk's fist against the crate; cheers] Ha! Yes!

Sea Hawk: [gruff, frustrated] Best three out of five!

Glimmer: [teleports next to them, slamming her hands on the crate] No! No more arm-wrestling. I spotted a ship graveyard in the distance and we're heading straight for it. [a low bellow sounds as a silhouetted figure swims beneath the ship] Is anyone worried about this?!

[A booming crash is heard and Glimmer screams in surprise while the ship shakes]

Glimmer: [nervously] What was that?!

Sea Hawk: [triumphantly] Aha! We're here.

[A crash booms again, wood creaking, and the ship shaking causes the crew to yelp and fall over; Glimmer, Bow, and Sea Hawk all go to look over the side of the ship, and Glimmer gasps; a serpent surfaces under the ship and rocks it, causing them all to fall back and shout; waves crash as the ship lands back into the water and they all get back up]

Sea Hawk: The Serpent of the Sea. I knew he'd be lurking in these waters.

Glimmer: [agitated, growls] Wait, you brought us here on purpose?!

[Glimmer and Bow scream as the serpent jumps out of the water and rocks the ship again]

Sea Hawk: You see, I don't just provide sea transport. [Bow grunts as Sea Hawk pulls him] I give you a tale to tell your friends! [pulls Bow and Glimmer to his sides] Come on, crew. We're in for a harrowing ADVENTURE!

[The serpent bursts from the ocean roaring, water crashing in its wake]

Adora: [off-screen] For the Honor of Grayskull!

[A flash of light off-screen and a magical hiss can be heard]

She-Ra: [running toward the bow, panting; voice trills] Waaatch thiiiiis!

[She-Ra leaps from the ship toward the monster, lifting her sword and shouting; she grunts and her sword clangs as she slams down and cracks the serpent's teeth; the monster roars and hisses as it slinks down under the surface, She-Ra yelling and water crashing]

Sea Hawk: Is that a normal thing she does?

Bow: Yeah. It takes some getting used to.

She-Ra: [bursts to the surface] Got it! [serpent drags her back under] Wait, no--!

Glimmer: [quietly, but gets louder; angrily] Let me get this straight. You steered us into a giant sea serpent just so you could, what, show off?!

Sea Hawk: [starts normally, then increases volume, upset] That was the plan, until your tall friend there STOLE my THUNDER!

Glimmer: [angrily] Unbelievable. We're trying to save Etheria and all you care about is whether we're impressed with you?! I need this mission to go right [shields her head, leaning down onto the railing; muffled] or my mom will never give me another one! [Takes a sharp breath in, then exhales a slight groan, standing back straight; quietly simmering] Just get us to Salineas. You've wasted enough of our time.

Adora: [surfacing, water splashing, giving a thumbs up; happily] Okay! Now, I got it. [chuckles] We're all good.

Glimmer: [agitated, clipped] Adora--! Get in the boat!


[Horde ship, stalled near the Sea Gate]

[Catra walks to the top of the ship, looking down on Kyle who is using a telescope to spy ahead]

Catra: [surprising Kyle to whimper] Why have we stopped?

Kyle: The Sea Gate is blocking our path. ...There's no way past, Force Captain Catra.

Catra: [voice higher pitched; incredulous] What?! [leaps down on top of Kyle's shoulders, grabbing the telescope and propelling herself off him, making him grunt and fall over; Catra lands on the bow railing and looks out with the telescope as it beeps into focus of the Sea Gate; agitated] Oh, Shadow Weaver didn't bother to mention that there was a massive gate blocking the way to Seaworthy?

Scorpia: [walking up] Wait, didn't you learn about the Salineas Sea Gate in Force Captain Orientation?

Catra: There's a Force Captain Orientation?!

Scorpia: [chuckles] Oho, yes there is!

[Catra groans; Lonnie and Rogelio laugh at Kyle in the background as Kyle vocalizes a pout; Catra stands and lashes her tail]

Catra: [yells] All hands on deck! We're finding a way through that gate.

Scorpia: [admiring] Oo, impressive Captain yell.

[Scene transition to just on the other side of the Sea Gate where the Dragon's Daughter III has docked; Bow's feet crunch on the shore as he leaps off the ship]

Bow: ...Where is everyone?

[Wind blows as they look on at the empty city]

Sea Hawk: Hmm...very odd, indeed. If I know the princess Mermista--and I-I do--something's amiss.

Salineas Guard: [yelling from far away, echoing] Halt! Halt! Halt, I say! [runs and pants towards the crew; with effort] ...Halt... [finally reaches them and stops to catch breath; out of breath] ...What's your business in Salineas?

Glimmer: We've come to speak with Princess Mermista--

Sea Hawk: [shouldering Glimmer out of the way; smugly] Tell her Sea Hawk is with them, she'll be excited to see me.


[Salineas throne room]

Mermista: [in a slight groan] Ew, who let him back in here?

[Sea Hawk runs to Mermista's throne as the crew and the guard follow at a walking pace]

Sea Hawk: Princess! Oh, it's been too long. I have dreamed of you night and day since we parted.

Mermista: Uh-huh... [at the crew behind him] And who are you?

[The Guard shoves Sea hawk from behind as they pass, making Sea Hawk grunt]

Glimmer: My name is Glimmer of Bright Moon. We've never met, but our parents fought in the Rebellion together.

Mermista: [disinterestedly] Oh, yeah... I remember hearing about the old Princess Alliance. My dad said it was a total disaster.

Sea Hawk: [to Mermista] I didn't think it was possible but your beauty grows greater with each passing day--

[Guard elbows Sea Hawk and he grunts]

Mermista: Will you quit it? I'm trying to talk to my new friend Twinkle. ...Butler [Guard quickly leans staff against the throne and dons a cloth over their arm] can you bring us some hors-d'oeuvres? [Guard walks away]

Sea Hawk: [trills] Oooo, hors-d'oeuvres!

Mermista: For everyone but Sea Hawk.

[Sea Hawk sits next to her/sidles himself onto the armrest of the throne]

Bow: Your guard is also your butler?

Mermista: I'm a little understaffed right now. [elbows Sea Hawk to get out of her space and picks up her staff] Everybody fled because the Gate is falling apart or whatever... [gets up to walk to a window]

Adora, Glimmer, and Bow: What?!

Mermista: [scoffs] Yeah, I know, right? [gestures with her staff and the water flowing over a window magically recedes] It figures that I would inherit a kingdom that's crumbling, but it's totally fine--I'm...handling it. It's just kind of inconvenient because the Horde won't stop attacking us...

Glimmer: Why is the gate falling apart?

Mermista: I mean, who knows, but it's getting weaker everyday, and if the Horde tries to attack us again, we're pretty much dead.

Glimmer: The Horde is the reason we're here. We want to rebuild the Princess Alliance. None of us stand a chance on our own, but we might be able to stop them together.

Mermista: [walking away from the window as the water begins to fall again, lightly hissing; chuckles darkly, half-scoffing] Yeah, cause that went so great the first time. Why should I help Bright Moon? It's not like they've ever done anything to help us.

Sea Hawk: Mermista, if I may--[begins to hum a shanty]

Mermista: No, no more shanties. [to Glimmer] Why did you bring him here? He is so [through clenched teeth, groaning] annoying...

Bow: [to Sea Hawk] I thought you said she liked you?

Sea Hawk: We have a rich and complicated past.

Mermista: [walking back to sit in her throne] If by that you mean you got us kicked out of the Dolphin Social for challenging the doorman to a duel, then sure.

Sea Hawk: [Mermista grunts as Sea Hawk flings himself into her lap, causing her to drop her staff, clanging on the floor; chuckles slightly] ...I don't recall doing that.

Mermista: And that time that you set our gondola on fire in the Tunnel of Love? [tosses Sea Hawk grunting onto the floor at the last word]

Sea Hawk: [righting himself and leaning on an elbow on her throne; chuckles, trilling] Ooo...that I do recall.

Adora: [walks over to a wall mural] ...This is First One's writing.

Mermista: And, who is she again? What is she doing?

Bow: That's Adora. She has a magic sword.

Glimmer: [running over to stand next to Adora] What does it say?

Adora: [touching the mural] Uh...it's something about the Gate... The First Ones must have built it. It looks like the Gate gets its power from the Salinean Runestone... It could be that the Gate is failing because it's losing its connection to the power source.

Glimmer: Do you think you can fix it?

Adora: [shrugging] I can try...

Glimmer: [walking back toward Mermista] Look, Mermista. You need our help, and we need yours. If Adora can repair your gate, will you consider joining us? Please?

Mermista: [throwing her head back making it pat softly on the back of her throne; groaning] I don't know...I guess... [pointing to Sea Hawk; enunciates] But he has to leave.

Sea Hawk: [sadly] But...where am I supposed to go?

Bow: [grabbing Sea Hawk by the shoulders and walking him toward the door; attempting reassurance] ...Maybe wait with the boat, okay, buddy? We'll take care of the gate.


[A rock floating just near the edge of the Sea Gate]

[The gate hums and makes glitching noises; spouts of water seep through the Gate, splashing on the other side; Glimmer, Bow, Adora, and Mermista walk up to the gap separating them from the gate]

Mermista: I really hope you know what you're doing.

Adora: [half-nervously] Uh...yeah, totally. [chuckles nervously] I got this... For the Honor...of Grayskull!

[A flash of light as Adora transforms into She-Ra]

Mermista: Wow. Okay. That's...different.

[She-Ra grips her sword with both hands and points it at the Gate, concentrating; the sword glows with magical energy that thrums and shoots out to the Gate; the Gate glows in return and begins to repair itself with digital beeps and hums; She-Ra grunts slightly as she struggles to upkeep the connection]

Bow: ...Is it working?

She-Ra: [gasps surprised at Bow, pointing her sword skyword and zapping energy; she begins to charge the Gate again; with effort, straining] Don't distract me...this is a lot harder than it looks...

[She-Ra continues to grunt as she charges the Gate, whirring noises and beeping signifying its repair]

Glimmer: [heaves a small but heavy sigh] This might take a while. [she looks through the Gate and spots Sea Hawk untying the docked ship from the shore; she groans] Ugh. Hang on. [teleports to Sea Hawk's side as he ties off a rope; he yelps at Glimmer's first word, surprised] Where are you going?

Sea Hawk: [haltingly, enunciating, panicked] I'd really appreciate it if you'd stop doing that.

Glimmer: Are you leaving without us?

Sea Hawk: It's for the best. I'm only getting in your way... [sighs] It's time for old Sea Hawk to be where he belongs: ...Alone. [sighs lightly again, walking to the side of the ship] It wasn't always like this. Where I'm from, I had friends...a crew. Every day an adventure more daring than the last. [half-chuckles] The fact that I kept setting my boats on fire was considered charming. [slight chuckle; then contemplative and introspective] But here, I can't even get anyone to take me seriously.

Glimmer: [stepping next to him] Yeah...I know a little about that. I can't get anyone to take me seriously either.

Sea Hawk: You? But you're a princess....

Glimmer: Try being the daughter of an immortal queen, when your powers are [whispers frustratedly, hands glowing magically] "sparkles."

Sea Hawk: Glitter--

Glimmer: [agitated, enunciates] Glimmer.

Sea Hawk: --we just met, but I can tell you are a brave and powerful soul. Anyone who'd underestimate you would live to sorely regret it.

Glimmer: Thanks, Sea Hawk. And you know what? You still have friends and a crew. [saluting, arm whiffs in the air] Reporting for duty, Captain!


[Floating rock near the Sea Gate]

[Mermista, She-Ra, and Bow stand while She-Ra concentrates and her sword hums with energy as the Gate repairs itself]

Bow: [looks behind him; nervously, voice cracking] Uh...Adora?

[The Horde ship sails into view]

Bow: [Waving and yelling to Glimmer and Sea Hawk on the Dragon's Daughter III] It's the Horde!

Glimmer: What?!

[On the Horde ship, Scorpia grunts as she presses down on a lever, charging a cannon with a thrum; a laser blast fires out and hits the Gate, creating a hole; She-Ra is zapped with electricity as the Gate is hit, making her shout in pain and stop charging the Gate; the barrel of the cannon hisses with discharged smoke as Catra notices the Rebellion crew and looks through her telescope at She-Ra, still electrified]

Catra: [to Scorpia] Keep us going full-speed. I've got something more important to do. [runs off]

[Back on the floating rock]

Bow: [to She-Ra and Mermista] They're coming for the gate!

She-Ra: [groaning as the electricity fades] I just need a little more time. [raising her sword to charge the gate again] Keep them busy.

[Bow grunts as he hops down the floating rocks and Mermista shouts as she transforms her bottom half into a mermaid's tail, diving and splashing into the water; the Horde ship sails closer and Bow grunts as he jumps a few more rocks, then fires a rope arrow whistling at the ship; he propels himself over to the ship and drives the edge of his bow into the sail to slow his descent, ripping the fabric; he lands on the deck, and fires an arrow at Kyle, pinning him by the shirt to the back of the ship with a thud; Lonnie readies her stun baton and yells, charging at Bow until they both collide in grunts and humming discharge from the stun baton and Bow's bow; they take swipes at each other and miss, and Bow laughs in triumph preemptively as he fires an arrow and misses, letting Lonnie leap into the air and lands onto Bow; Bow's arrow explodes goo all over Scorpia's cannon, and it fizzles with electricity]

Scorpia: Oh, come on.

[Bow punches Lonnie off him and she lands grunting; Lonnie shouts, caught off-balance by a large wave rocking the ship, Mermista diving back into the water nearby; Lonnie shouts and charges at Bow, Bow disarming her; Kyle runs at them both screaming and hoisting his stun baton haphazardly, while Bow grabs Lonnie and tosses her into him; a spout of water coming over the side pushes them into the water, Mermista diving back into the ocean again; Scorpia grabs Bow by the shirt collar]

Bow: Oh. ...You're big.

Scorpia:[tosses Bow off the ship in a whoosh] See ya!

[Bow screams as he falls toward one of the Horde ship's engine blades; Sea Hawk swoops in on a rope and collides, thudding, into Bow, rescuing him]

Sea Hawk: Gotcha.

Bow: [in admiration, voice cracking] Sea Hawk!

[Sea Hawk laughs triumphantly as he swings them onto the nearby Dragon's Daughter III, Mermista propelling herself onto the deck with a water spout as well]

Glimmer: Bow! Are you all right?

Bow: [quietly] That was...[shouts in awe] AMAZING!

Sea Hawk: Thank you for noticing, Bow. It was amazing.

[The Horde ship's laser fires again as the ship races toward the Gate]

Sea Hawk: Nothing's slowing them down. What do we do?

Glimmer: I think I have a plan. But no one is allowed to tell my mom about this. Sea Hawk, I need your help. I need you to do what you do best.

Sea Hawk: What?

Glimmer: [enunciating] Set your ship on fire.

Sea Hawk: [happily] Yes!


[Horde ship]

[Lonnie and Kyle grunt as they hold back the lever for the cannon as it fires another laser blast at the Gate; when the blast connects, She-Ra cries out in pain as electricity zaps through her and she momentarily stops charging the Gate; Catra lands on the sword in metal clang]

Catra: [laughs] Wow. You know, the tiara actually gets stupider the more I look at it.

She-Ra: [continues to charge Gate] Catra... How did you find me? [cries out in pain when a cannon blast hits the gate and she is shocked again; quickly starts charging the gate again]

Catra: Did you think it would be that easy to escape the Horde? I mean, I always knew you were kinda dumb, but... [her claw tinks as she pokes She-Ra's tiara, making her grunt slightly] come on.

She-Ra: What's your plan, insult me until I decide to rejoin the Horde?

Catra: I don't think Shadow Weaver is planning to give you much of a choice. But, yeah, something like that.

[Catra extends her claws and swipes at She-Ra, clanging off her metal bracer; Catra leaps off the sword while She-Ra is shocked again]

Catra: [tauntingly] Check it out. Looks like with you gone, I got your promotion. [gestures at Force Captain badge]

She-Ra: [gruff with effort and frustration] Congratulations.

Catra: Seems like only yesterday this was the thing you wanted most in the world. And now you're--[groans disgustedly, gesturing at She-Ra's body] ugh. Come on, Adora, hasn't this all gone on long enough?

She-Ra: I told you before, Catra. [enunciates, more frustrated] I'm not. Going. Back.

[Catra grunts in anger, then leaps around She-Ra, scratching at her a few times while She-Ra attempts to block with her bracers; Catra gets inside her guard and grabs her arm, punching her in the stomach and making her kneel while she groans in pain]

Catra: [grabbing She-Ra's face as laser blasts fire in the background, shocking She-Ra] This is what you left me for? Dress-up games and a light show? [humorless slight chuckle] And your new friends are nowhere to be seen. [leans in to speak into She-Ra's ear] When did you get so weak?

[A geyser of water bursts up and splashes Catra, screaming, off the rock; Bow, riding on Mermista's back in the ocean, cheers and then they both dive under the water, suddenly bursting back up again as Mermista transforms her tail back into legs and lands with Bow on the rock next to She-Ra]

She-Ra: [breathes out, relieved] Thanks.

Mermista: [blushing, dismissively] Yeah, whatever, don't mention it.

[Meanwhile, the Gate hums, losing energy; on the Horde ship, Lonnie and Kyle man the cannon, and Scorpia looks on]

Sea Hawk: Ha ha!

[The Dragon's Daughter III skirts quickly around the Horde ship, then doubles back, heading straight at the Horde ship]

Glimmer and Sea Hawk: [happily] Adventure!

[Glimmer teleports them off the Dragon's Daughter III; the ship combusts]

Lonnie: What the heck?!

[The flaming ship and Horde ship sail full-speed at each other, and the Horde crew scream and jump ship right before the two ships collide and explode;the wreckage sinks down under the waves; Glimmer and Sea Hawk teleport next to Bow, and they all cheer; She-Ra takes a deep breath and concentrates, her aura glowing; the sword sends out charging energy to the Gate again, She-Ra groaning in effort as the Gate magically repairs itself fully; Catra bursts out from underwater nearby, gasping for air, and Scorpia swims by on a piece of driftwood to haul her away]

[The Rebellion crew cheer and celebrate]

Mermista: Yay, that was cool. I'm...over it, though.

[Bow hugs Adora as Glimmer squeals in happiness next to them, and Catra looks on, sighing as she's hauled through the water]


[The Rebellion crew stand on the shore just outside the Sea Gate]

Mermista: Huh, what do you know, you actually fixed it.

Adora: It's beautiful.

Mermista: [to Sea Hawk] I guess you're gonna be needing a new ship? [groans; dismissively while gesturing behind her] I suppose you can have one of mine...

[Behind the group, a different ship sits on the shore, and the Guard christens the ship by breaking a bottle on the side, glass shattering]

Sea Hawk: [whimpers happily] ...She's gorgeous...

Mermista: Don't set it on fire.

Sea Hawk: [quickly] No promises. [slower paced] But, Princess, [takes Mermista's hand and kneels] if I might ask for one more favor?

Mermista: [groans] You're always ruining it.

Sea Hawk: [grabbing Glimmer and putting his hands on her shoulders] You should think about joining Glimmer's Princess Alliance. [places hand on chest] She is a brave and strong captain. [clenches fist] With her at the helm, she is sure to lead the Rebellion to victory.

Glimmer: Aw, Sea Hawk... [lightly elbows him] You even got my name right.

Mermista: Okay, I'm in.

Glimmer: Really?

Mermista: Yeah. The Horde almost destroyed my home. I wanna help fight them. [gestures at Adora] Plus, your friend over there can turn into like an eight-foot tall lady with a sword, and I want her on my side.

[The crew cheers Mermista as Glimmer hugs her and Adora puts an arm on her shoulders, while Sea Hawk says: Excelsior! Huzzah!]

Mermista: Wow, okay, calm down.

Glimmer: You won't regret this, I promise.

[Bow and Sea Hawk start to sing a shanty together]

Bow and Sea Hawk: [singing] The Best Friends Squad on the seas We subdued the threat / The threat with ease! We sail the world / Come near or far We're Best Friends / We are, we areWe're Best Friends / We are, we are!

[Sea Hawk laughs triumphantly as they all stand together]
