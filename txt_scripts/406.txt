Scorpia: [happily] Good morning, world! Force Captain Scorpia, reporting for duty! [steps out of bed and sighs] Wake up: check. [walks to a mirror and picks at her teeth with a claw] Looking sharp: check. Breathe in new day: [takes deep breath in and out] check. [blanket rustles as she makes her bed] Make bed: check. [metal bowl with various screws/nuts scrapes on the ground as she slides it to Emily] Feed Emily, although I'm still not sure that you eat...: check.

[Emily beeps and whirs as she powers on; she rolls to get upright, bumping into Scorpia's dresser]

Scorpia: Whoa, hey! Careful there. [Scorpia's leather jacket from the Crimson Waste flutters to the ground; she picks it up] Cool, right? Catra gave it to me in the Crimson Waste. She's got a matching one, it's like, our thing, you know?

[Emily stamps one leg, and beeps and whirs at Scorpia]

Scorpia: I know, I know, she said we're not friends anymore...but she didn't mean it. And maybe I misheard her, there was a lot going on. There was a cannon. [places jacket back on dresser; looking in mirror, to herself] Push down doubts and insecurities: [deep breath out] check.

[Scorpia walks down a hallway to a hangar]

Scorpia: [confidently] I am brave, strong, loyal, and give great hugs. [gets more confident and increases volume as she goes] And I am going to be the best friend that I CAN BE!

[Scorpia half-laughs confidently as a door opens to get to a hangar where a bunch of Horde soldiers run around yelling in a panic, as things are knocked over and people fall and run into each other; some things that they yell at each other that can be heard are: "Come on! Let's go! Move! What are you doing?!" "Darryl! Seriously?!" "Watch out! I'm coming through--"]

Scorpia: [confidently] Yep. Today will be a great day! [a shout and a thud can be heard off-screen as smoke covers the view of Scorpia]

[Opening theme]


[Horde outpost, just beside a canyon]

[Wind howls through the canyon; a Horde soldier is flung over the side of a cliff, screaming; Glimmer teleports them back to land, and they thud with a grunt]

Glimmer: You dropped one!

She-Ra: My bad! [her sword clangs as it makes contact with more soldiers; she flings another one screaming over the cliff]

[Glimmer teleports the soldier back and drops them unceremoniously; soldier's boots thud as they surround Glimmer, and she charges her fists; an arrow comes in and nets a soldier before Glimmer can do anything]

Bow: Watch your step! [he jumps down from a ledge and lands near Glimmer in a thud, firing more net arrows at soldiers running at them; he draws another arrow] At this rate, we'll have the supply line open in no time. Just hang back. [he shoots, his arrow whistles off-screen]

[Glimmer groans, then gasps when she notices a soldier in the distance, who is confusedly grunting while looking at their person]

Flutterina: [holding a stun baton; innocently] Looking for this?

[The soldier shouts and runs at Flutterina, but they grunt as Glimmer teleports in front of them and stops them]

Glimmer: This one's mine.

[Glimmer teleports them to a secluded area and charges her fists; the soldier grunts in fear and attempts to back up, almost stumbling as rocks crumble into the canyon just behind them; they "uh" hesitantly]

Glimmer: Looks like it's your lucky day. [draws a magical rune] I've got this rune I've really wanted to try out.

[The soldier groans nervously and Glimmer throws the rune; it fizzles just as it reaches the soldier, who confusedly says "Huh?"; the soldier shouts and jumps at Glimmer, who shouts in response, charging her fists; She-Ra's rope snags around the soldier and pulls them back]

Glimmer: [annoyed] Hey! [She-Ra grabs the rope and soldier] I had that one!

She-Ra: [sits the soldier down] You are the Queen. I can't let anything happen to you. [The soldier attempts to run as the rope is released, but shouts as they are immediately snagged in a net by Bow] Besides, whatever dark magic Shadow Weaver taught you [gets quieter, pouting] obviously doesn't seem to be doing the job...

Glimmer: It's not dark magic. [teleports closer to them; frustrated] And it would have been really cool if it had worked!

Bow: [happily] Aw, you guys! Look at us! [squishes She-Ra's and Glimmer's faces in his embrace, making them grunt] The Best Friend Squad back together again!

Flutterina: [jumps into frame next to everyone, making them grunt in surprise; shouting merrily] Whoo! Take that, Horde! [happily trilling] Best first Rebellion mission ever! Thank you so much for letting me come.

[The soldiers caught nearby in nets groan and struggle a bit]

Glimmer: This can't be all of them. Where's the rest? There aren't even any bots.

Flutterina: I didn't see any others. [chuckles slightly] They probably ran away scared.

She-Ra: [triumphantly] All right! We should head out. We've still got another outpost to shut down before we can re-open supply lines to the Kingdom of Snows. Come on! Let's move. [Walks off, Bow follows]

Flutterina: [in awe] Wasn't She-Ra amazing in that battle? You are so lucky she saved you before that Horde soldier reached you.

Glimmer: [annoyed] She didn't save me! [haltingly] I was...doing...a thing.

Flutterina: [feigning disarmingly] Oh, right. I mean, your little magic trick would've been really cool if it had worked! Anyway, your real strength is in teamwork! And the way you let Adora give you orders even though you're the Queen, I-I--

Glimmer: [frustrated] She wasn't giving me orders. We're a team!

Flutterina: The greatest team! That's why she can talk to you like that, all, [mimicking stern voice/Adora] "I'm She-Ra, I know best!", but you stay friends. [sighs] What a bond...

[Glimmer groans and walks off]

Flutterina: [in a deeper, more malicious tone, to herself] Like lambs to the slaughter... [blinks with Double Trouble's eyelids; then, in a happy, bright tone, calling out] Hey, guys! Wait for me!


[The Fright Zone, Hordak's Sanctum]

[Hordak stomps toward Catra, growling; monitors around her beep]

Hordak: [angrily] The Rebellion is dismantling our northern perimeter. Why are our outposts unprepared for an attack?

Catra: [the monitors in front of her beep when she taps on them] Because they're skeleton crews. I've called back the main defenses.

Hordak: [angry disbelief] What? Why?

Catra: [laughs humorlessly, dragging a hand down her face] Okay...[takes a small breath in] The princesses have no idea what's coming. Let them waste their time on some useless outposts. We are saving our resources for the big mission. [places hand on a montior] The final part of our plan, remember? [almost desperately] It's almost time.

Hordak: [walks toward a work station; quietly] We're...not ready. [places hands on table] I need more time to complete the weapon.

Catra: [angrily] We've put everything into this plan. We don't have more time.

Hordak: [angrily, quietly] This technology...is based on Entrapta's research, but I've reached a dead-end. [sighs] I need her notes...her recordings. [picks up a piece of scrap, presumably Entrapta's; almost desperately] They must hold the key to making this work...

Catra: [slowly, angrily] Entrapta is a traitor.

Hordak: [smashes piece of scrap in his hand, pieces clattering to the ground; angrily, shouting] You think I don't know that?! [more quietly, angrily] This is what she left behind. And this is what I will use to defeat every last princess on Etheria. Horde Prime will be here soon, and when he arrives he will see what I am capable of... I will return to his side--victorious...worthy. But first...[growling, slowly] I need. Those. Recordings.


[Fright Zone, hallway]

[Scorpia walks along, tea in claw; Emily mechanically whirs as she trots behind her, her legs creating metallic thuds on the floor; Scorpia whips around a few times to see, but Emily evades her; Scorpia hums and shrugs, then chuckles; finally Scorpia catches her, laughing]

Scorpia: [happily scoldingly] Emily! You know you're supposed to stay in my room. Ya little scamp. [Emily whirs and beeps disappointedly] Come on, no guilt trip, it's for your own good. We can't let Catra see you, and right now? I'm bringing her a cup of my famous soothing tea. ...Old family recipe. If anyone could use a pick-me-up, it's Catra.

[Emily whirs and beeps disheartened, beginning to walk away; she turns around halfway]

Scorpia: Go on.

[Emily walks a little faster away; a bit further, she turns again]

Scorpia: [complying] Aaah, okay, you can come. [Emily rushes back] Can't say no to that cute little face.

[halfway through Scorpia's indulging, Emily jitters fearfully and whirs as she rushes the opposite direction]

Scorpia: Hey, I said you can come, where are you--

Catra: Who are you talking to? [Scorpia yelps and jumps, making the tea splash up and back into the cup]

Scorpia: Catra! Oh! [squeakily laughs nervously] Hot! Okay, boy, you can really [chuckles] sneak up on a gal. [clears throat; takes a breath in, then concernedly] ...Oh, are--are you okay? You don't look so good, I--have you been getting enough sleep? ...Here. I made you some--

Catra: I didn't ask for your opinion. I have a job for you. I need you to find Entrapta's recordings, you know, that thingy she was always babbling into.

Scorpia: You want...Entrapta's recordings? Does this mean--

Catra: It means...that Hordak needs them. [places hand on forehead, deep breath out; quietly] I'm so close. If I can pull this off, everything, everything will have been worth it. [more sternly] Find me those recordings so I can finish this.

Scorpia: [higher pitched, agreeably, almost nervously] Yes! Yes, I'll find them. I-I promise. D-Did you want any of the...tea? ...You know what, it's not a--

Catra: [snags the tea from Scorpia's claw and slurps it down; sighs; the cup clatters on the ground when she throws it down as she's finished] What are you still doing here?! [hisses and walks off]


[The Fright Zone, an outside loading bay]

[Horde soldiers mill around working, a dull roar of machinery can be heard; Emily's legs thud with a metallic clang she walks, Scorpia following]

Scorpia: See, Emily? What did I tell you? Catra just needed a loyal friend. I'll find those recordings, she'll do her mission, and then she can relax, and things will go back to normal.

[Emily stops and turns to her, beeping]

Lonnie: [calling out from a nearby transport] Scorpia! A little help? [grunts with effort lifting a box]

[Metal rumbles as Rogelio strains to lift a container; he squeals as Scorpia picks it up]

Scorpia: Hey, guys! Can't stay long. [Rogelio's claws scrape into the metal, struggling to hang on] I'm on a super important, top-secret mission for Catra. [chuckles, then shakes the container, Rogelio bounces and growls struggling to stay on]

Lonnie: [a container scrapes as she pushes it into the transport; scoffs, disdainfully] Good luck with that. I'm sure Catra will be super grateful.

Scorpia: [lets go of the container she and Rogelio struggle for, Rogelio roaring as it thuds and collapses on top of him; incredulously] Uh, yeah. Of course she'll be grateful. [begins to place container's from the transport onto the ground as Lonnie grunts to lift them onto it] Everything Catra's done has been to help the Horde. And if we stick with her, keep doing our jobs...I'm sure she'll notice. [quieter] ...You know...e-eventually...

Lonnie: [angrily, disbelieving] Yeah, right. Our guys are getting attacked on the northern perimeter [two injured soldiers walk nearby; Rogelio roars and squirms beneath the container]...and Catra's letting it happen. She doesn't care about any of us.

Scorpia: No. No, you're wrong. Catra's been...under a lot of pressure...and maybe she just...

Lonnie: [scoffing, angrily, shouting] When are you gonna wake up?! [pausing, looking at Scorpia's containers] ...Hey! We were supposed to be loading these onto the transport. Scorpia...[groans, placing a hand on her head] just get out of here. [walks off, annoyed] We've got real work to do.

Scorpia: [confidently] Good idea. You go do your job, and I'll do mine. [quietly, sadly] Just a...well-oiled machine...


[A different Horde outpost]

Bow: [seriously ,suspiciously] I don't see any defensive bots here, either. Honestly, it doesn't look like there's anyone on watch.

She-Ra: But we don't know what they've got inside the outpost, so let's go in nice and slow. [Glimmer groans to herself] Here's what we're gonna do...I--[Glimmer teleports; She-Ra shouts] Glimmer!

[Glimmer teleports onto part of the outpost between two guards, who gasp and charge at her with stun batons, shouting; she teleports away and they grunt as they stun each other, electricity sparking; they grunt as they fall, and Glimmer teleports to the ground, where a soldier charges her, screaming; Glimmer charges her fists]

She-Ra: [Runs up and thwacks the soldier away with her sword, and they grunt; annoyed] Glimmer, what are you doing? You can't just rush into battle on your own like that, you're the Queen! [scoffs] You're too valuable.

Glimmer: [angrily] Am I the Queen? Because it seems like you're the one giving all the [blasts a soldier who grunts on the last word] orders.

She-Ra: [laughs humorlessly] And what's your plan? More dark magic? [she throws a soldier rushing them into a far wall with metal creasing and their scream; they thud on the ground]

Glimmer: [frustratedly] It's not dark magic! And I don't know, [groans] maybe if it helps me do what needs to be [blasts another soldier, they shout] done!

She-Ra: [angrily] Magic won't fix everything, you know! [Flutterina dodges and kicks a soldier off a ledge, grunting]

Glimmer: [angrily, voice fading as Flutterina speaks] What good is magic if I can't use it!

Flutterina: [as Glimmer and She-Ra continue to argue; in a low tone, to herself] Double Trouble, sometimes you're too good...

She-Ra: [fading back in] --you have us for!

Glimmer: [shooting magic blasts; angrily] I don't need you guys [Bow shoots a soldier charging a stun baton blast with a goo arrow, and they grunt] to save me! Stop treating me like I'm weak and let me make my own decisions! [Bow gasps, looking down at them]

She-Ra: [a blast magically glancing off her shield] We're just [spinning to whack another and they grunt] looking out for you!

Bow: Hey! What's going on with you two?

She-Ra and Glimmer: [simultaneously shouting angrily] Nothing!

Bow: [slightly annoyed] Okay, we're talking this out. Adora, is there something [She-Ra grunts as she strains her shield against a soldier with a zapping stun baton] you need to say to Glimmer?

She-Ra: No! I don't know! What, it's fine!

Bow: [draws and fires an arrow that whistles off-screen; encouragingly] Come on, you can do it! Communication is the key to a good friendship!

She-Ra: [grunts as she pushes the solider away with a metallic shing; annoyed] I don't know why Glimmer is suddenly okay with trusting Shadow Weaver after everything she's done to us! I'm just--I'm worried about her [trips a soldier]...it's too dangerous.

Glimmer: [grunts as she fires a blast at the soldier who grunts; a goo arrow encapsulates a soldier beside her; annoyed] You really think I'm naive enough to trust her?

Bow: [lands beside her, putting a hand on her shoulder] Glimmer. Would you like to try phrasing that a little more constructively?

Glimmer: [sighs, exasperated] Everything I'm doing is to protect people...is to protect you. [She-Ra grunts as she strains against a soldier, then flips them and they thud] I'm not asking you to trust Shadow Weaver...but...[dodges a stun baton swipe zapping, then blasts the soldier away] can't you at least trust me?

[She-Ra grunts as another soldier rushes her, straining with a zapping baton; she knocks them away and they scream]

She-Ra: Of course I trust you, Glimmer.

Bow: [elongating syllables encouragingly] There you go. [pulls both into an embrace] That's how the Best Friend Squad does it!

Flutterina: [to herself; groans disdainfully] Ugh, I have to do everything around here.

[Flutterina spots soldiers nearby, then appears behind them after they shout, attempting to run away; they gasp in fear]

Flutterina: [shouts feigning fear, echoing] HELP! HELP! [both soldiers gasp in fear and confusion; Flutterina squeals and jumps into one's arms] SHE-RA, HELP!

Glimmer: Flutterina!

Flutterina: [still shouting, feigning fear] HELP! HELP! Put me down! [the soldier gasps a little and drops her immediately and she yelps and thuds on the ground; they back away, but Flutterina grabs their baton and whispers angrily] I'm on your side. Now follow my lead... [she clears her throat to call back out to the BFS, screaming louder and waving her arm] HEEEELP!


[Fright Zone, Entrapta's old lab]

[Scorpia hums disapprovingly as she rummages through machine parts in a box, tossing items that clatter on the ground]

Scorpia: [calling over her shoulder] Anything yet?

[Emily pops out of another box and whirs and beeps, shaking its body negative; it dives back in]

Scorpia: [sighs slightly] Aah, I know we've looked everywhere, but it's gotta be here somewhere...

[peeks under the couch she sits on and picks up a photo that flutters a bit]

Scorpia: [remembering, softly] Super Pal Trio. Man, those were good times, huh? [suddenly, she sniffs and shakes her head, shouting, to herself] Focus! Scorpia, you can't let Catra down. ...Think like Entrapta... Think like Entrapta... [groans, straining; she pops up behind Emily, mimicking Entrapta's voice nasally] Bots! [Emily jumps; Scorpia suddenly hangs from the ceiling] Ehh, Hordak... [she falls and yelps, thudding on the floor] Tiny food. [she rolls over] Uh...First Ones tech... Runestones... [gasps loudly, in her normal voice] The Black Garnet Chamber!

[The door to the Black Garnet Chamber slides open with a whir; Scorpia and Emily peek inside, Emily whirs and beeps]

Scorpia: [breathes out in unease] Yeah, this place also gives me the creeps. [determined] But, some of Entrapta's stuff is still in here, so the recordings might be, too. [she and Emily walk further in; Scorpia chuckles a little, rummaging through some things; happily] Wow. So many good times in here, huh? That time Entrapta hacked the Black Garnet...That time Shadow Weaver tried to kill us...And...before that...[chuckles slightly; Scorpia looks up at the Garnet and a slight whooshing and whispering can be heard, as if voices are layered together; the Garnet shines with a shing] You're not going to believe this, Emily, but I'm actually a princess.

[Emily whirs, turning around, making surprised beeps]

Scorpia: I know, right? That's what they all say! [laughs] It's ridiculous, I know, but...it's true. The whole Fright Zone used to be my family's kingdom, but then Hordak showed up and...well...you know. The rest is history. [chuckles; then somberly] It's not like the Black Garnet ever worked for me anyway...

[The whooshing and whispering come back as Scorpia reaches out toward the Garnet; it ceases when she pulls away]

Scorpia: Ah, it's for the best. I mean, can you imagine? Me, a princess? [sighs; then quickly] I just need to find those recordings and then--[Emily beeps and bumps Scorpia's shoulder softly]

[Emily whirs and turns, suddenly projecting a recording of Entrapta; Scorpia gasps]

Recording Entrapta: Commencing experiment number 703. Ready, Emily?

Scorpia: [amazement] Entrapta?

Recording Entrapta: [laughs loudly] Success! In addition to uploading back-ups of my logs into Emily's hard drive, I've upgraded her to record visual data. [trilling] Hiiii! Now when an experiment blows up and I lose all memory of that day, I'll still have record of the research. [pulls Catra and Scorpia into her with her hair, causing them to grunt] Everyone, smile!

Recording Catra: [pushes her away] I told you to be ready to leave. Have you even started packing?

Recording Entrapta: I'm a scientist. The only thing I'll need in the Northern Reach is my miiind! ...Also my giant drill. ...Also...everything in this room.

Recording Scorpia: [happily] Super Pal Trio field trip! Ah, I can't wait! We can watch the snow fall, drink hot cocoa...

Recording Entrapta: [excitedly] Oh, can the hot cocoa's be tiny?

Recording Catra: [groans, disdainfully] We're there to dig up First Ones tech, we're not making cocoa.

Recording Scorpia: Oh, that's my Wildcat, always on goal. [chuckles slightly] ...What do you think is buried out there, anyway?

Recording Entrapta: [excitedly wondrous] Ohhh, something biiig!

Recording Catra: Who cares? Pack your stuff and let's go already.

Recording Scorpia: [suggestively] I'll bring the cocoa if you bring the tiny mugs...?

Recording Entrapta: [higher pitch] Oh, it's a date! [giggles and high fives Scorpia with her hair]

Recording Scorpia: Yeah!

[Recording stops with a beep; the projection glitches away, Emily whirring]

Scorpia: [somberly] I...I miss her. [suddenly excited] Wait, Entrapta's recordings...she stored them inside you?! [picks up Emily and she whirs] We did it, you beautiful bot, we found them! Oh, we've gotta go tell Catra that--[Emily whirs] ...Well, can't you just take them out? [Emily beeps; Scorpia grows more and more upset] Not possible?! [Emily beeps] They're deeply ingrained in your core processor and can't be accessed without dismantling you completely?!

[Emily beeps in confirmation; Scorpia sits her down with a thud]

Scorpia: [frustrated] But Catra needs these recordings, and I wanna be there for her! I'm loyal, [chuckles slightly] that's my whole thing--[Emily beeps, running to hide; Scorpia tries to be reassuring but is hesitant] ...I'm sure it'll be fine. She wouldn't hurt you. She wouldn't...even though the recordings are...inside you and...she's kind of said the words "scrap metal" and "Emily" together a lot. ...Come on, I know a great place to hide--I-I mean, think, not hide. We're not hiding, we're...thinking. That's it.

[Scorpia walks off and Emily whirs and follows; the Garnet shings, making the whooshing noise slightly]


[The Horde outpost]

[Flutterina shouts, struggling in the soldier's hold]

She-Ra: Bow, can you take them out?

Bow: I can't risk hitting Flutterina!

Flutterina: [cries out; then whispers at the soldier holding her, annoyed] Come on, work with me here!

Soldier: [confused, slowly] Uh...drop your weapons...or the girl...gets it?

Flutterina: [in a low tone to herself, groans] Ugh, it'll do.

Glimmer: [angrily] Let her go, now. Or it's not gonna be pretty. [charges her fists]

She-Ra: [placing a hand on hers] Glimmer, no. They could hurt Flutterina.

Glimmer: [discharges her fists, but draws a rune; angrily] Someone has to do something. [she grunts as the rune is thrown toward the soldiers]

[The soldiers are encompassed in a magical field, lifting them into the air shouting in fear; it dissipates and they crash to the ground screaming; Glimmer teleports one away, thudding when they hit the ground]

Glimmer: [shaking the soldier by the collar, making them grunt] Why isn't anyone guarding these outposts? Where is everyone?

Soldier: [nervously, fearfully] Ah, I don't know!

Glimmer: [draws a rune] I haven't practiced this one as much...I'm still getting the hang of it. [slightly amused] It's a truth spell, if it works...but if it fails, it can be...extremely painful.

Soldier: [fearfully, putting up their hands] Okay, okay! Catra called back our bots and most of our team, but--I don't know why, I swear! [Glimmer finishes the rune] I don't, I really don't!

Glimmer: [pushing the rune closer; slowly, quietly] I think you do...

Bow: [shouts] Glimmer, stop!

Glimmer: [lets the rune dissipate] Catra pulled her forces from the northern perimeter. We've been wasting our time all day. And this guy...[she raises her fists and the guy cowers, squeaking in fear; angrily] is wasting mine. [teleports near Bow and begins to walk away] Bow, put him back with the others and let's go.

She-Ra: [concerned] Glimmer, what are you doing? You took things way too far.

Glimmer: [annoyed disbelief] I wasn't going to actually hurt him. Did you think I would really--

Bow: Look, maybe we should get some rest and talk about this when--

She-Ra: [seriously, sternly, at Glimmer] The Kingdom of Snows' supply line is open. We're done here.

Glimmer: Fine by me. [teleports]

[She-Ra walks off, Bow gasps and follows]

Flutterina: [in a low tone] And scene. [blinks with Double Trouble's eyelids]


[The Fright Zone, Scorpia's secret spot (aka her family's throne room, Horror Hall)]

[Machinery whirs outside; Emily's footsteps whir as she and Scorpia walk into a building]

Scorpia: Welcome to Horror Hall! It was part of the royal Scorpion Family's kingdom, but nobody comes here anymore. [chuckles slightly] I would sneak down here to hide when I was a kid. Yeah... [looks at wall murals] Oh! Check out these guys! That's Pointy, over there is Captain Pointy, and this here is the widow Madame Pointessa. [Emily beeps] Okay, I made those up, I don't know their names. [laughs] But this!

[Scorpia rushes over to the throne's wall with Emily following]

Scorpia: This guy...this is my granddad, the King. He was the greatest. I mean, that's what the Horde told me anyway, I don't remember him, I was too young. [Emily walks away] I have granddad to thank for my opportunities in life. He made the alliance with Hordak. As part of it, our kingdom gave up our Runestone...and...princess...[chuckles somberly slightly] My granddad must've known I'd be...happier...as a soldier. And I made friends in the Horde...like you!

[Steps when she sees Emily staring at Horde graffiti over a mural]

Scorpia: [quietly, somberly] Ah. Okay, well... [walks to Emily's side] Things didn't exactly work out for my kingdom, but...granddad stayed loyal to the end. That's what scorpions do best! Brave, loyal...great hugs.

[Emily whirs as she bumps Scorpia, and Scorpia hugs her]

Scorpia: I need to be there for Catra. I'll just tell her about the recordings. She is my friend, and she will not hurt you if I ask her not to.

[Emily whirs, shaking its body negatively, then projects a recording of Catra stunning Entrapta]

Recording Catra: [angrily] I don't care what it takes. We are opening that portal! NOW!

Recording Entrapta: [yelling] No! I won't! I need to tell Hordak, he'll understand!

[Entrapta shouts as she is zapped by Catra, then thuds on the ground]

Recording Catra: [fades as Scorpia reasons aloud] Get her out of here! I don't care--! Put her on the transport to Beast Island!

Scorpia: [reasoning, quietly] She--she was threatened. She didn't mean it...

Recording Scorpia: Beast Island?! You can't!

Recording Catra: [baton charging] You wanna be next?

[Scorpia gasps softly; Emily shuts off the projection]

Scorpia: [quietly] Catra...betrayed her. ...She betrayed me. And I just let her take Entrapta away... Catra doesn't...care. She'll hurt people to get her way. If she knew the recordings were inside of you...

[Emily whirs]

Scorpia: [determined] But I still have time. I can still be a good friend.


[The Fright Zone, a hallway]

[Catra grunts and paces]

Catra: [sharp intake of breath as she sees Scorpia] You better have something for me.

Scorpia: [holds out a piece of metal; feigns hopeful] ...Entrapta's recordings. She stored them all in Emily.

[Catra takes the piece of metal]

Scorpia: The chip got damaged when I extracted it, but...hopefully that won't matter? It was just so small, and you know...pincers.

Catra: [slowly] You broke...the recordings?

Scorpia: [almost fearfully] I-I didn't mean to--

Catra: [throwing aside the piece, it clatters; shouting angrily] I asked you to do one thing! One simple thing and you completely ruined it! [more quietly, manically rambling] But of course you ruined it. Yeah. You're Scorpia. That's just what you do! You couldn't handle Emily...You never know when to shut up...The only thing you've ever done [her claws shing as they slice through the air] is get in my way! What did I expect, I mean, how could you possibly be this useless?!

[Scorpia stands silently, looking away]

Catra: What?!

Scorpia: [quietly] ...You're a bad friend.

[Scorpia walks away]


[The Fright Zone, Hordak's Sanctum]

[Catra looks at the metal piece, twitches her ear and smooths down her hair, she breathes out; the door opens]

Hordak: [excited expectation] The recordings?

[The door whirs closed; Catra grips the piece tightly in her hand, hiding it behind her]

Catra: Entrapta must've taken them with her before leaving. There's nothing.

[Hordak growls and shouts, shoving metal scraps and pieces off the workbench, they clatter around]

Hordak: [pants, angrily] I gave you...an order...

Catra: [enunciatingly, angrily] Get. Over. It. [growing steadily more angry and impassioned] You don't need Entrapta. You never did. You don't need a princess in your life telling you what to do. Look at what you've done without her. You built an army. An empire. [quieter, more desperately] You and me...we don't need anyone. [more manically, tone pitching higher at first] Forget them all, no one matters, [angrily] nothing matters but this mission. [pants] You want to prove yourself? Prove your worth? Then do it. You and I are going to conquer Etheria, and then...and then, they'll all see!

[Catra pants; Hordak lifts a piece of metal from the bench, under which another piece has a gem that shines]

Hordak: [reflecting, determined] Oh, of course... [picks up the piece] Yes. We will prevail. Give me another day, and I will be ready.

Catra: [quietly] Does that mean...I can give the command?

Hordak: [slowly] It is time.


[The Fright Zone, Horror Hall]

[Scorpia walks in; rocks rumble behind her; Emily whirs and beeps, popping out and running to Scorpia; the bot clunks as Scorpia hugs it]

Scorpia: [quietly, conspiratorial] Okay, I bought us some time. Catra didn't know that was just old junk or that I was...lying to her. [breathes out] ...There's nothing I can do for her...but maybe I can still help Entrapta.

[Emily raises up and whirs]

Scorpia: [as Emily walks up next to her and she puts on a pack] Ready for a Super Pal Duo field trip? [Emily beeps; Scorpia speaks determinedly] We're getting out of here, Emily. For good.
