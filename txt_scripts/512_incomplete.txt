Perfuma: These flowers really bring out the color of your eyes.

Swift Wind: Bow, could you stop playing that thing?

Bow: Hey I'm still learning.

Glimmer: Well, I like it.

Bow: Hey!

She-Ra: [Looking grim.] Prime is getting closer everyday to figuring out how to access the Heart of Etheria. If he succeeds, he can use it to destroy worlds, galaxies,maybe even the entire universe. [A view of Prime sitting in his throne room.] The Failsafe is our only chance at stopping him. But Prime still has our friends. [An up close view of Prime's throne, Mermista and Scorpia are standing right beside it.] His hold over them grows stronger every day they are chipped. If we don't free them now, we might lose them forever. [The sickening green veins of Horde Prime's brainwashing grow longer in the chipped. The camera goes back to the main room of the Rebellion.] Prime holds every advantage in this fight. He'll be ready for us. But we have a plan. Entrapta?

Entrapta: [Walks up with her hair.] I finally succeeded in cracking Prime's signal pattern. If I can get access to his Spire network, I can broadcast a jamming frequency that will disable all of the chips on Etheria, freeing everyone at once!

She-Ra: I need you all to get Entrapta to the Spire and keep Prime's forces distracted while she jams the signal. I'm gonna take the Failsafe to the Heart and destroy it, once and for all. We're going to make sure that Prime can never hurt anyone again. We're ending this today, for good. [Camera goes back out to the crowd and everybody cheers]

Sea Hawk: [In the background] Ha-cha! Friendship! [She-Ra struggles to keep her form, She starts to walk away, Bow and Glimmer look concerned and follow her outside where she transforms back into Adora.]

Adora: Oh.

Bow: You weren't trying to sneak out without us, were you?

Glimmer: Any sign of Catra?

Adora: She's not coming back. Are you sure you guys should come? We don't know what to expect from the Heart of Etheria. It- It could be dangerous for you.

Bow: There's no way we're letting you do this on your own. Whatever we find, we face it together. [They all hug and look at each other lovingly. Adora walks forward.]

Adora: For the honor of Grayskull! [She transforms]

Theme song plays

[The scene opens on the Crystal Castle. The camera moves to the inside, where Bow, Glimmer and She-Ra are walking through the corridors. They get to the main room, where Light Hope's hologram is glitching ominously. When they approach, she goes back to normal.]

Light Hope: Warning.Planetary Facilitator Light Hope protocol offline. Manual administrator access not reccomended at this time.

She-Ra: We are friends of Mara. Now show us where the Heart of Etheria is.

[Light Hope turns pinky red and scans She-Ra up and down. She goes back to normal.]

Light Hope: Welcome, friends of Mara. [She disappears and a door opens up behind her.]

[Bow, Glimmer and She-Ra join hands and share a knowing look, before walking into the corridor. She-Ra looks back, nervously.]



[Catra is riding Melog through the Whispering Woods. She looks back and Melog stops abruptly, throwing Catra off of their back.]

Catra: Ow! What is wrong with you?!

[Melog 'walks in front of Catra and headbutts her, mewing softly.]

Catra: Stop it! Stop it! [She pushes Melog away.] I told you I'm not going back.

[Melog growls and tackles Catra.]

Catra: You saw what happened! Adora chose Shadow Weaver, okay? Not me! Adora doesn't want me. [She looks away, dejectedly.] Not like I want her.

[Melog sits up and licks Catra's face comfortingly. Catra sits up and hugs them.]

[Footsteps approaching.]

[Melog conceals Catra with their invisiblility power. A Horde clone walks by, and they follow it.]



[Camera opens on a Horde spire, a battalion of bots and drones are standing watch and doing routine patrol.]
