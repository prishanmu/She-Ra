# She-Ra and the Princesses of Power
Text Analysis of Scripts from the recent Reboot of She-Ra and the Princesses of Power

**Background Information**

She-Ra and the Princesses of Power is a Netflix reboot of the 80's cartoon, She-Ra: Princess of Power. Over the past few years, 52 episodes have come out and the series' stories have concluded. The series is known for its variety of representation, both causual and central to the story, and themes of friendship, abandonment, colonialism, and queer relationships. As a fan of the show and data scientist, I wanted to look deeper into the dailogue of the show.

**Data Source**

I gathered transcripts from a She-Ra fan-made wiki page. Since this source is dependent solely on fan contributions, there may be some mistakes and certain episodes do not have complete scripts.

Below is a list of episodes for which I did not obtain a completed script: 

* Season 1, Episode 5
* Season 1, Episode 7

Note: So far I have only obtained the first 8 episodes of scripts. I will be updating as I obtain more.
